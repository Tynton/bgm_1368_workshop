 mil_tech_cs_3_name:0 "Combined Arms"
 mil_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "Combined arms warfare was first used in the early to mid 14th century during the Hundred Years' War by the English. It would go on to influence strategies of commanders uninterrupted from here to modernity."
 mil_tech_cs_4_name:0 "Steel-lathed Crossbow"
 mil_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "Crossbows have already been around for some time but the innovation of steel implemented into the design of some of its components meant it now possesses a higher tensile strength, allowing more effective use on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_5_name:0 "Gunpowder Corning"
 mil_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "Corning means to ground down the propellant to fine grains. Gunpowder corning allows the propellant to ignite more effectively, ensuring better battlefield performance."
 mil_tech_cs_6_name:0 "Indirect Warfare"
 mil_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "Sometimes it isn't the right call to fight the enemies' armies. Sometimes it's instead more intelligent to instead destroy the enemy's ability to maintain their war effort. The armies of the Italian states in the 14th and 15th centuries learned of this themselves."
 mil_tech_cs_7_name:0 "Plate Armor"
 mil_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "There was already an assortment of armor varieties in the thirteen-hundreds but most recently came the most protective. Plate Armor does not reduce a soldier's mobility as much as it may seem. Mobility is always of value and to sacrifice too much of it for armor-protection would not be doing one a service."
 mil_tech_cs_8_name:0 "Ascendancy of Polearms"
 mil_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "Like with many other inventions, polearms are not unique to the Middle Ages. However, warfare has evolved such that the use of polearms was considered the most intelligent choice by commanders and logisticians in an era where effective fighting range was slowly becoming more important."

 adm_tech_cs_3_name:0 "Three Field System"
 adm_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "The Three Field System is a manner of agriculture in which plants are planted in a three-year cycle. One plant variety is grown in year one, another in year two, and another one in year three. First developed in China, it would become commonplace in Europe in the Late Medieval period."
 adm_tech_cs_4_name:0 "Quarantine"
 adm_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "Quarantining sick individuals was a practice inspired from the events of the Black Death and its subsequent outbreaks. Plague Doctor protective equipment were another similarly timed invention, enabling medical personnel to interface with the infirm without risk of exposure to disease."
 adm_tech_cs_5_name:0 "Striking Clocks"
 adm_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "Striking Clocks were a method of timekeeping for a city jurisdiction. They could be engineered to strike at certain times of day but were most often noted to sound off at noon. They could sound off once an hour during the late mornings or early afternoons, in addition."
 adm_tech_cs_6_name:0 "Papermaking"
 adm_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "Papermaking is a practice initiated in China but spread to Europe through the Arabic world. It was not of too much use in Europe though until movable type came to be there, by which point paper saw immense use."
 adm_tech_cs_7_name:0 "Autocracy"
 adm_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "The political trend through the world has been to distance from feudal regimes and the social upheaval they now cause. Depending on the region the transition to despotic states may have already began or would do so by the late fifteenth century. By the sixteen-hundreds though autocratic states were the norm."
 adm_tech_cs_8_name:0 "Blast Furnace"
 adm_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "Blast furnaces are useful for the industry of metallurgy. They were not everywhere however but as needs arise, so too will the answers. Metals have been proven far superior materials for warfare for their general sturdiness. As such the demand for states to acquire the means to provide vast amounts of metals was a necessity."
 dip_tech_cs_9_name:0 "Post Mill"
 dip_tech_cs_9_desc:0 "First appearing in the twelfth century, Post Mills have seen widespread use in Europe and beyond for centuries. Initially though windmills were used for cereal grinding, splitting the grains from the wheat chaffs."

 dip_tech_cs_3_name:0 "Horseshoe"
 dip_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "Horseshoes see use in improving the distance a horse can travel. Normally the environment may compromise the hooves but the introduction of iron horseshoes now allows longer distance travel as the horseshoes themselves have to brave the elements on the ground."
 dip_tech_cs_4_name:0 "Interregional Commerce"
 dip_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "The Mongol Empire established, albeit unintentionally, a trade network between China and Europe. Though the Black Death most likely travelled along this path, so too would notable merchants such as Marco Polo and others. The Silk Road has been as such popularized as a means of importing spices from East Asia to the courts of Europe."
 dip_tech_cs_5_name:0 "Early Carrack"
 dip_tech_cs_5_desc:0 "The Galleys are good enough naval vessels for the Mediterranean but larger vessels would be needed for oceangoing travel. Enter the Carrack, a large vessel developed in Portugal and Spain for use on the high seas, and unstoppable by other ships."
 dip_tech_cs_6_name:0 "Mercantilism"
 dip_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "A Florentine philosopher has written a commercial treatise promoting mercantilism. The ideal is to minimize imports while maximizing exports, thus increasing profitability and decreasing reliance on foreign powers for access to trade items."
 dip_tech_cs_7_name:0 "Compass Navigation"
 dip_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "It was not until rather recently that compasses have seen new use as devices of waymaking. Seafaring vessel commanders will most certainly find use in this trend for more accurate navigation wherever on the Earth they may find themselves."
 dip_tech_cs_8_name:0 "Long-Distance Commerce"
 dip_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "This refers to the use of ships for long-distance travel specifically. Ships in this day and age could carry far more than most convoys on land. In addition to this, aside from pirates, there are not too many threats to a ship's voyage, unless one includes even the most remote possibility of being robbed at a harbor."




 mil_tech_cs_39_name:0 "Field Howitzer"
 mil_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "A howitzer is a type of artillery piece characterized by a relatively short barrel and the use of comparatively small propellant charges to propel projectiles over relatively high trajectories, with a steep angle of descent."
 mil_tech_cs_40_name:0 "Percussion-cap Weapons"
 mil_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "The percussion cap, introduced circa 1820, is a type of single-use ignition device used on muzzleloader firearms that enabled them to fire reliably in any weather conditions. This crucial invention gave rise to the caplock or percussion lock system."
 mil_tech_cs_41_name:0 "Mass Industrialization of Military Equipment"
 mil_tech_cs_41_desc:0 "Although military equipment has for a while been produced by factories around this time sees the regulation, standardization and proliferation of mass-production for military equipment. Guns, artillery pieces and other military hardware now can be produced en masse."
 mil_tech_cs_42_name:0 "Breech Loading Weapons"
 mil_tech_cs_42_desc:0 "Breech loading weapons have been in existence since the 14th century, but haven't been popular until recently. Breech loading weapons load their ammunition into a chamber from a latch or hatch behind the chamber, unlike muzzle loading weapons which insert a projectile from the frontal bore."
 mil_tech_cs_43_name:0 "Bolt-Action Rifle"
 mil_tech_cs_43_desc:0 "Bolt action is a type of firearm action where the handling of cartridges into and out of the weapon's barrel chamber is operated by manually manipulating the bolt directly via a handle."
 mil_tech_cs_44_name:0 "Long Range Artillery"
 mil_tech_cs_44_desc:0 "Rifled Artillery has the benefit of spinning a projectile, adding great accuracy. This also stabilizes the projectile so it does not veer off course and though this statement is a redundancy in noting its accuracy, it also improved its effective range."
 mil_tech_cs_45_name:0 "Trench Fortifications"
 mil_tech_cs_45_desc:0 "Trenches are most famously used during World War One as a reaction to the increasing firepower of modern arms, such as machine guns. Trench Warfare itself was in a strategic sense exceptionally slow, at least to change the dynamics on the frontline. It was broken when it was discovered that Battle Tanks could bypass the trenches themselves and eliminate any defenders."
 mil_tech_cs_46_name:0 "Armored Vehicles"
 mil_tech_cs_46_desc:0 "Armored Vehicles are any kind of vehicle - most notably tanks - using metallic armor plating of various types. Tankettes and Armored Cars are other types of armored vehicles, some of which barely preceded the conception of the Battle Tank in World War One."
 mil_tech_cs_47_name:0 "Inter-War Air Forces"
 mil_tech_cs_47_desc:0 "Although planes have existed since the 1900s (before 1910) as an advent of the Wright Brothers' design, they were limited to mostly a passive role as a scout vehicle. This did not stop fighter planes during World War One (most notably the Red Baron, a German pilot) from being used to shoot down enemy scouts. Also, light strategic bombers did exist as far back as the 1910s."
 mil_tech_cs_48_name:0 "Early Modern Tanks"
 mil_tech_cs_48_desc:0 "The modern conception of tanks generally includes a 420 degree rotating top-mounted turret affixed with a main cannon of at least 20mm or higher, sometimes with a coaxial machine gun mount next to it. This was not always the case with Battle Tank technology as some tanks during World War One had several turrets on the sides (see Mark tank series enumerated I-X) but some light tanks from that era had a somewhat modern design philosophy."
 mil_tech_cs_49_name:0 "Submachine Gun"
 mil_tech_cs_49_desc:0 "Submachine guns were at the time a lightweight full-automatic weapon system, the most mobile of handheld infantry weapons. Though they were in part superseded by Personal Defense Weapons and Automatic Rifles during the later stages of World War Two and beyond, they still hold their own to this day as a useful weapon of choice for various applications."
 mil_tech_cs_50_name:0 "Nuclear Weapons Research"
 mil_tech_cs_50_desc:0 "Nuclear weapons have been hypothesized even before and during World War I. H.G. Wells was interested in it and wrote "The World Set Free" in 1913. It featured atomic weapons, but even earlier than that (the late 19th century) it was proven that uranium could release large amounts of radioactive energy."
 mil_tech_cs_51_name:0 "Proliferation of Jet-plane technology"
 mil_tech_cs_51_desc:0 "Jet planes have been around since late World War II. Turbojets (the most common type of jet engine) were invented prior to it but the war caused innovations to it for military applications. Now we are seeing the development of jet engine technology and its usage in air forces, which is most likely here to stay."
 mil_tech_cs_52_name:0 "Kevlar"
 mil_tech_cs_52_desc:0 "Kevlar (invented by Stephanie Kwolek) is a heat resistant and also strong synthetic fiber. It has been used most famously by militaries as a form of body armor but has civilian uses."
 mil_tech_cs_53_name:0 "Ballistic Missile Guidance"
 mil_tech_cs_53_desc:0 "Ballistic Missiles are long-range missiles normally used to carry nuclear warheads. They have also been used by space agencies to carry probes, astronauts and equipment to other planets and their moons."
 mil_tech_cs_54_name:0 "Electronic Warfare"
 mil_tech_cs_54_desc:0 "Electronic Warfare is the discipline of using electronic devices, both hardware and software, to undermine efforts by our enemies. They can be used both during peacetime and during war for disinformation practices."
 mil_tech_cs_55_name:0 "Laser-Based Missile Defense"
 mil_tech_cs_55_desc:0 "Although lasers have been commonly considered in science fiction as direct-fire weapons for use against both armored and unarmored targets, the issue present with it is that so far the power sources for lasers strong enough to do that do not currently exist. They can, however, be more practically used to shoot down missiles of varying degrees."
 mil_tech_cs_56_name:0 "Stealth Aircraft Proliferation"
 mil_tech_cs_56_desc:0 "Stealth aircraft have existed for a while but advancements in the technologies relating to sensory avoidance and/or deprivation have made stealth technologies more viable. This may also initiate other trends or continue existing ones, in the instances that some combat operatives prefer mobility over protection, stealth technology can also help take care of issues of protection. One does not need armor if he cannot be detected, after all."
 mil_tech_cs_57_name:0 "ETC Autocannon | Mobile Railgun"
 mil_tech_cs_57_desc:0 "Electrothermal-Chemical and Railgun technologies both are an improvement in the propulsion of projectiles over smokeless powder, among other things. Electrothermal-Chemical technology seeks to pair electricity and plasma with an explosive to better ignite the propellant in a casing for tank shells to increase velocity, thus increasing the kinetic energy contained within the projectile. With armor technology becoming rather advanced, kinetic penetrators need more velocity. In extreme cases, railguns may be of necessity."
 
 dip_tech_cs_39_name:0 "Gold Standard"
 dip_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "Fiat currency existed in some form as a medium of exchange for centuries but translating it into gold (adoption of the Gold Standard) wasn't done much until the 1800's as the United Kingdom was the first to implement a system, followed by many other western powers."
 dip_tech_cs_40_name:0 "Steel Can"
 dip_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "A steel can is a container for the distribution or storage of goods, made of thin metal. Many cans require opening by cutting the "end" open; others have removable covers. They can store a broad variety of contents: food, beverages, oil, chemicals, etc. Steel cans are made of tinplate (tin-coated steel) or of tin-free steel. In some dialects, even aluminium cans are called "tin cans"."
 dip_tech_cs_41_name:0 "Steam Engines for Ships"
 dip_tech_cs_41_desc:0 "Steam Engines are a new method of propulsion for seafaring vessels. They do not require a large amount of operators as raft-propelled ships do, and they do not rely solely on the wind to guide the ship along. Truly, a revolutionary invention."
 dip_tech_cs_42_name:0 "Ironclad"
 dip_tech_cs_42_desc:0 "Ironclads were the first iron hulled vessels in naval history. Because of this they were much sturdier than their counterparts and quickly became the standard for ship-of-the-line models, beginning in Britain."
 dip_tech_cs_43_name:0 "Oil Extraction"
 dip_tech_cs_43_desc:0 "Oil extraction is a process by which oil reserves are located through seismic measurement and excavated. Following the seismic analysis, a drill is used to access the oil reserves, through which it can be harvested."
 dip_tech_cs_44_name:0 "Early Dreadnought"
 dip_tech_cs_44_desc:0 "Dreadnoughts are an early form of Battleship characterized by having their arsenal completely dominated by large caliber cannons. The first ship of this type was known as the HMS Dreadnought, in service with the British Fleet in the early twentieth century. The ship would inspire development of future battleship vessels."
 dip_tech_cs_45_name:0 "Proliferation of Refrigeration"
 dip_tech_cs_45_desc:0 "Previously, all food preservation was done with salt as it dehydrated food items. Hydration is a key condition for decomposition and as such drying out meats or other consumable items was most important, especially for naval voyages. Now we do not have to concern ourselves with this as industrial technology allows us to instead freeze dietary items prior to heating and consumption."
 dip_tech_cs_46_name:0 "Film"
 dip_tech_cs_46_desc:0 "In the eighteen-nineties in Paris there was a convention for new technologies to be unveiled and one such technology was Film. Using specialized devices such as a film sheet and lighting, it is now possible to play individual frames from footage at rapid pace, enabling an illusory effect of animation. Films and hand-drawn animations would both seek inspiration from this seminal work for decades to come."
 dip_tech_cs_47_name:0 "Mass Communication Technology"
 dip_tech_cs_47_desc:0 "Communication with the masses was for the most part, historically speaking, enabled by pamphlets or newspapers. With Industrialization and its many Pandora's Boxes being opened by society, we now have a new device which can transmit audio from one source to a destination or destinations. Enter the Radio."
 dip_tech_cs_48_name:0 "Battleship"
 dip_tech_cs_48_desc:0 "Battleships retain similarities with their Dreadnought precursors. However, Battleships again diversified their arsenals between large caliber and medium caliber cannons. This diversity allowed Battleships to better adapt and engage various classifcations of targets, something Dreadnoughts would suffer in trying to do."
 dip_tech_cs_49_name:0 "Diplomatic Globalization"
 dip_tech_cs_49_desc:0 "Though the world has seen globalization for several centuries by now, nations did not always consider others from other corners of the world as equals. As the West moved toward more liberal values, things such as decolonization and the Cold War made this necessary."
 dip_tech_cs_50_name:0 "Early Plastics"
 dip_tech_cs_50_desc:0 "Plastics are synthetic materials used in many commercial products around the world today, though clearly this wasn't always the case. Plastics became more frequent sights in the mid-late 20th century after new, popular forms of plastic were invented."
 dip_tech_cs_51_name:0 "S.I. System"
 dip_tech_cs_51_desc:0 "The System International (French), or known in English as the International System was a system of units and measurements built around the base-ten Arabic numeral system which had won out over Roman numeration around the Renaissance and after. Exploiting the decimal nature of this allows mathematics to become more intuitive than it was previously, even under measurement systems like the Imperial system."
 dip_tech_cs_52_name:0 "Missile Ships"
 dip_tech_cs_52_desc:0 "Missile ships use missiles as an important armament of choice as missile guidance systems became more developed. With this increased the maximum effective range and accuracy of the ships themselves and allowed for more complicated attack patterns than their older brethren of the Battleship."
 dip_tech_cs_53_name:0 "Commercialized Computers"
 dip_tech_cs_53_desc:0 "Computing technology has existed for most of the 20th century already but developments and high prospects of the technology of information sharing have us conclude that furthering the betterment of this technological choice should be our top priority. Information dissemination and control are vital for all regimes, democratic or not."
 dip_tech_cs_54_name:0 "Biotechnology | Early GMOs"
 dip_tech_cs_54_desc:0 "Biological research has been around in its more modern incarnation since the mid-nineteenth century. Anesthesia, surgery and medicinal chemistry in a secular form had arisen since then and now we have came a long way. To a point even that directly interfacing with the most fundamental aspect of life - the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is now attainable in primitive forms in laboratories. Its first application would be seen in Genetically Modified Organisms tailored for human consumption."
 dip_tech_cs_55_name:0 "Internet Commercialization"
 dip_tech_cs_55_desc:0 "While the Semiconductor and by extension the digial computer have been around for a while already, the advent of the tools needed to create a civilian network of computers has already seen a large number of applications. Expanded socialization or access to knowledge means a responsibly handled Internet could bring about a new era of unrestricted human development. It could also be used by state or non-state actors to facilitate compliance."
 dip_tech_cs_56_name:0 "CRISPR Gene Augmentation"
 dip_tech_cs_56_desc:0 "We have stumbled across what may full well be an exceptionally valuable discovery. The E. Coli bacteria uses a gene known as CRISPR and its associated Cas9 protein as a defensive mechanism from viral infection. The RNA (or in some cases, DNA from bacteriophage viruses) is sampled and added to the E. Coli's genome. This can also be used as a gene-editing package introduced to human cells by way of a tailored virus. It is believed upwards of half of the human genome is already junk inserts from historic infections, so there is little reason to believe that utilization of the CRISPR gene in human cells is possible. The question now becomes, what will come of it?"
 dip_tech_cs_57_name:0 "Bioweapons | Superhumans"
 dip_tech_cs_57_desc:0 "The age of genetic augmentation is upon us. A new arms race between states concerns itself no longer with nuclear weapons, but instead with the creation of bioweapons and the means to counter them. For the human race, there is no reversing of the Crossing of the Rubicon. Now, it is a case of determining whether Humanity has doomed itself in doing so or if it enters an era of unprecedented expansionism in all fields, studies and indutries."
 
 adm_tech_cs_39_name:0 "Provincial Railroads"
 adm_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "Formerly, and for as long as human civilization has existed, there was at least a way to pass information and items along for long distances. But roads, ships and horse carriages can be slow. With coal, though, we can use trains. An industrial technology, trains have no need for food or rest. They need only coal which is a flammable solid, to turn the machinery to spin their wheels along pre-defined and constructed tracks which can run as long as is necessary."
 adm_tech_cs_40_name:0 "Societal Modernization"
 adm_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "Industrialization has brought about joblessness for many people. In addition to this, lifestyles and standards of living are in the process of changing and all of this occurring simultaneously with the spread of novel ideas culminates in unrest. Nationalism and the desire for change from feudalism to novel ideologies and institutions seeds an era of general discontent with the powers that be."
 adm_tech_cs_41_name:0 "Telegraphy"
 adm_tech_cs_41_desc:0 "Telegraphs were in the early development phase since the eighteen-thirties. They would be the first method of near-instantaneous communication between distant areas but would not see practical use in and of themselves for common citizenry, not for quite a long time anyway."
 adm_tech_cs_42_name:0 "Electric Lightbulb"
 adm_tech_cs_42_desc:0 "Gas lamps and candles, though already in widespread use, require a fuel to use. Electrical lighting however does not need this and can also be used as long as there is an electrical current. The coming decades will see a gradual shift from conventional lighting to electrical lighting for all night-time needs."
 adm_tech_cs_43_name:0 "Propagation of Electric Appliances"
 adm_tech_cs_43_desc:0 "This time sees the expansion of large-scale power stations to feed society's growing demand for electrical power. Although the aforementioned lightbulb needs electrical power, other inventive minds have created devices which can provide or consume electrical power, and/or both."
 adm_tech_cs_44_name:0 "Airplane"
 adm_tech_cs_44_desc:0 "Human attempts to take flight have been recorded as far back at least as Leonardo da Vinci in the Renaissance. However, none of these attempts would work as they would at most serve as gliders. Propulsive power is vital for long-term flight and now we can mount engines and propellers to manipulate the air to generate thrust. Long form flight is now attainable thanks to the merging of these technologies known as the air plane."
 adm_tech_cs_45_name:0 "Aluminium Smelting"
 adm_tech_cs_45_desc:0 "Aluminium is a light elemental material which has found use in applications requiring lightweight materials. Planes and cans both are notable uses of this material."
 adm_tech_cs_46_name:0 "Revanchist Politics"
 adm_tech_cs_46_desc:0 "As society proceeds ever forth, there are souls that long for the past. For a time which we were great. Recent times have exacted an unjust robbery of our pride and prestige and now we must look to new individuals and movements to recover it."
 adm_tech_cs_47_name:0 "Authoritarian Innovation"
 adm_tech_cs_47_desc:0 "In recent times a rise in the number of authoritarian or totalitarian states mandates the growth of the administration to be able to peer into the lives of their constituent citizens. Innovativeness in this aspect is much required and it is the states' responsibility to ensure good behavior in their citizens. After all, dissidence creates disasters."
 adm_tech_cs_48_name:0 "Early Decolonization Age"
 adm_tech_cs_48_desc:0 "The social shock in the years past from colossal confrontations and mass death requires society to review its morality. Should we doom young men to die who would have otherwise lived productive lives?"
 adm_tech_cs_49_name:0 "Nuclear Power Plant"
 adm_tech_cs_49_desc:0 "Nuclear technologies don't always need to have destructive use. The energy released from fission reactions can easily make uranium a viable power source for our nation's communities."
 adm_tech_cs_50_name:0 "Color Television"
 adm_tech_cs_50_desc:0 "RGB color definitions emerged in the 1950s-1960s as Cathode-Ray Tube television screens. In 1954 the first CRT television was designed but grayscale would remain the norm until the 1960s when many televised programs transitioned to color."
 adm_tech_cs_51_name:0 "FG-MOSFET Transistor"
 adm_tech_cs_51_desc:0 "Transistors are extremely common in modern computers but were pioneered and developed in the 1950s-1970s. FG-MOSFETs are commonly used as a floating-gate memory cell, the digital storage element in EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory technologies."
 adm_tech_cs_52_name:0 "Early Space Age"
 adm_tech_cs_52_desc:0 "Satellites and humans may have been launched into space already, but we are confident that this is only the beginning. Inspired by these, authors and filmmakers are interested in exploiting these developments for profit. We see their opportunities as our own; let us motivate the people to support space expeditions."
 adm_tech_cs_53_name:0 "Modern Administration"
 adm_tech_cs_53_desc:0 "Data entry into computers makes many things much easier. The ease at which errors can be accounted for and corrected no longer requires things like erasers or whiteout but a simple press of a few keys. Administrating has never been easier."
 adm_tech_cs_54_name:0 "Gen III Nuclear Reactor"
 adm_tech_cs_54_desc:0 "Generation III Nuclear Reactors are different from Generation II in the advancement and redundancy of safety measures. Nuclear disasters in the years past have raised awareness in the public eye and fear of nuclear contamination or other dangers related to it mean the nuclear industry is under high levels of supervision for fear another safety mishap may cause a large crisis."
 adm_tech_cs_55_name:0 "Internet"
 adm_tech_cs_55_desc:0 "While the Semiconductor and by extension the digial computer have been around for a while already, the advent of the tools needed to create a civilian network of computers has already seen a large number of applications. Expanded socialization or access to knowledge means a responsibly handled Internet could bring about a new era of unrestricted human development. It could also be used by state or non-state actors to facilitate compliance."
 adm_tech_cs_56_name:0 "Mobile Devices | Internet of Things"
 adm_tech_cs_56_desc:0 "Phones have became something of a right of passage to adulthood in the eyes of the common citizen, knowingly or otherwise. It is a great responsibility from their perspective given the expense to acquire one. However, citizens may be sometimes responsible with the handling of their devices, but are they responsible with its usage?"
 adm_tech_cs_57_name:0 "Space Travel Commercialization"
 adm_tech_cs_57_desc:0 "Space travel has been in its times of naissance a purely exploratory endeavor. One would be mistaken in assuming it was purely an exploration of the Universe around the Earth in earnest. It was also an exploration in the techniques and methods of navigating space as well as the engineering process to design the vehicles for such journeys. Now the methods are refined, we must refine the engineering for the economy's sake. A new renaissance may soon bless us as we can tap into the economic potential of celestial bodies such as the Moon and beyond."
