Either a miracle or a ring of talented politicians is needed now to ensure the Yuan restores its position, or at least not collapse under its own weight..."

 bgm_yua_infinite_administration_title:0 "Colossal Administration"
 bgm_yua_infinite_administration_desc:0 "Almost every time there is a sufficiently sized bureaucracy it is rife with corruption and is also almost never streamlined.
