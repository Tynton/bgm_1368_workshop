 eng_naval_superiority_title:0 "Naval Development"
 eng_naval_superiority_desc:0 "England is unique in that it is the dominant kingdom on an island - Britain. Fielding a large army is on its own vital, but we also face the challenge of maintaining a powerful presence on the seas."
 eng_beat_western_navies_title:0 "Destroy the Western Fleets"
 eng_beat_western_navies_desc:0 "Now $COUNTRY$ is the proud owner of a powerful naval presence, it's time to use it now to force the capitulation of the rival powers' navies of Europe."
 eng_fate_castile_title:0 "Fate of Castile"
 eng_fate_castile_desc:0 "The succession crisis in Castile has been brought to a close. We stand to gain benefits from this either way but even more so if the house of d'Ivrea secures the throne once again."
 eng_mobilize_army_title:0 "Mobilize Army"
 eng_mobilize_army_desc:0 "To realize the unity of England and Ireland we must construct a large army to simultaneously enfeoff the Irish Clans to our cause."
 eng_subordination_of_ireland_title:0 "Subordination of Ireland"
 eng_subordination_of_ireland_desc:0 "The English Crown has asserted dominion over the fiefdoms of Ireland. Much like the appanages in France, they will be of great service in the security of the realm."
 eng_the_good_parliament_title:0 "The Good Parliament"
 eng_the_good_parliament_desc:0 "There have been widely circulating rumors that the Royal Court is a bastion of corruption. $MONARCH$ should call a parliament to address these concerns."
 eng_secure_funding_title:0 "Secure Funding"
 eng_secure_funding_desc:0 "Faith in the government has been restored. With more wars looming for one reason or another it's time to once again tackle the issue of funding for the Crown's war debts. Through good will or taxation, the English state must see that it has no debts and a surplus in its treasury."
 eng_fate_lollards_title:0 "Fate of the Lollards"
 eng_fate_lollards_desc:0 "A certain preacher by the name of John Wycliffe has gained controversy. Hated by the Church but supported by John of Gaunt, this man preaches a number of unorthodox beliefs found heretical by the Catholic Church. His influence has spread enough such that even the Pope has ordered a condemnation of Wycliffe and his supporters..."
 eng_peasants_revolt_title:0 "Peasants' Revolt"
 eng_peasants_revolt_desc:0 "Discontent with the sociological changes in recent decades paired with policies the peasantry views as exploitative has exploded into an English Peasants' Revolt. It must be put down or avoided altogether, should such a thing be possible..."
 eng_seize_northern_france_title:0 "Seize Northern France"
 eng_seize_northern_france_desc:0 "We have footholds in France but need a sizeable authority in the northwestern reaches of the region before proceeding further... Perhaps if we defeat the French with enough fervor we can guarantee additional concessions to the inclusion of the cities of Paris and Rheims themselves."
 eng_kill_scotland_title:0 "Enfeoff Scotland"
 eng_kill_scotland_desc:0 "Perpetually a thorn in our side, the Scottish Kingdom has consistently aligned with the Crown of France.

 eng_fra_conquest_brittany_title:0 "Conquest of Brittany"
 eng_fra_conquest_brittany_desc:0 "Brittany makes a decent ducal realm to secure as one potential base of operations in France. Numerous ports, a history of hostility to the state east, and small enough so as to not be of consequence should there be an attempted rebellion for independence..."
 eng_fra_recover_anjou_title:0 "Recovery of Anjou"
 eng_fra_recover_anjou_desc:0 "Anjou was once the seat of the Court of Plantagenêt but was lost centuries ago.

 eng_fra_fate_burgundy_title:0 "Fate of Burgundy"

 eng_fra_lorraine_title:0 "Conquest of Lorraine"
 eng_fra_lorraine_desc:0 "A peripheral French realm, Lorraine has avoided the jurisdiction of France for ages as it remained under the loose authority of the Holy Roman Emperor. No longer, a Strong Western Kingdom will oversee its unification with the Crown of Anjou."
 eng_fra_wallonia_title:0 "Conquest of Wallonia"
 eng_fra_wallonia_desc:0 "Wallonia remains an area which has not answered to the French authority to any known immediate history. Once a part of Middle Francia, Wallonia has instead been a part of the Holy Roman Empire for centuries. It's time to rectify this situation."
 eng_fra_breton_naval_bases_title:0 "Breton Naval Bases"
 eng_fra_breton_naval_bases_desc:0 "In order to further reinforce the English Mainland from attacks from any naval powers we may also consider development of the coast of Mainland France. Brittany contains many ports and remains the geographical centerpiece of the Atlantic Coastline of France."
 eng_fra_port_cities_title:0 "French Port Cities"
 eng_fra_port_cities_desc:0 "Trade between Britain and Mainland Europe could stand to be facilitated with relative ease with development of the Northern French ports. Were these to be developed, who knows what potential for large amounts of casual commerce awaits?"

 eng_fra_nobility_desc:0 "The Nobility of France have been the main driving force of the concept of sovereignty.

They should be replaced with English Nobility instead, at best.."
 eng_fra_parlements_title:0 "Augment the Parlements"
 eng_fra_parlements_desc:0 "The Parlements of France are the judicial apparatus of their government. Though England is the senior member of our union to see legitimacy in the French realms we must syncretize the legal systems."
 eng_united_bank_title:0 "The United Bank"
 eng_united_bank_desc:0 "Funding systems are still not one between England and its junior France. Funding troubles have been a hallmark of the Hundred Years' War. Therefore, it is imperative that the treasuries and banking institutions of both realms be united into a common pool of reserve money for crises or extensive infrastructure projects."
 eng_fra_coronation_at_reims_title:0 "Coronation at Reims"
 eng_fra_coronation_at_reims_desc:0 "Reims contains the Holy Cathedral used to coronate the French Kings. Now that we are the Kings of France, it is of great symbolic use to us to utilize the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Reims to coronate $MONARCH$ as not just the King of England, but of France."
 eng_fra_joint_drilling_title:0 "Joint Drilling"
 eng_fra_joint_drilling_desc:0 "The Military can be considered the most valuable institution to heads of state, irrespective of government or ideology. It is also very dangerous to not at least attempt to foster cooperation between the armies of an overlord and his subject.

 eng_fra_intermingling_cultures_title:0 "Intermingling Cultures"
 eng_fra_intermingling_cultures_desc:0 "With the Wars of French Succession concluded we can repair the cultural rift that has since opened between the British Isles and the Gaulish Region of the French."
 eng_fra_lingua_franca_title:0 "The Lingua Franca"
 eng_fra_lingua_franca_desc:0 "Anglo-French Culture has been ascendant in the jurisdiction of the $COUNTRYADJ$ for some time. As the Crowns are united we can and should take action to consolidate the linguistic diversities of our constituent regions into one hybrid."
 eng_fra_consolidation_title:0 "Consolidated Crowns"
 eng_fra_consolidation_desc:0 "The two Great States of Western Europe have once been made to answer to the whims of feudal nobility. As the times are changing, so too are the political trends in the world. Modernization of both these realms facilitates centralized administrations which would make inheritance a bit easier."
 eng_centralize_the_banking_institutions_title:0 "Centralize Banking"
 eng_centralize_the_banking_institutions_desc:0 "There is a centralized Bank of England and France but thus far we've only created that. We have yet to formalize it as the top of the hierarchy and it may be of use to appoint officials loyal to it to the other moneylending bureaus in France and England."
 eng_fra_seneschal_appointments_title:0 "Seneschal Appointments"
 eng_fra_seneschal_appointments_desc:0 "The Seneschals are enforcers of order, in its most vague interpretation. Appointed by royal courts, these offices are instrumental in seeing justice through but can also be utilized as a manner of management for concordance between the Mainland Domains and England proper."
 eng_fra_reconciliation_title:0 "Reconciliation with France"
 eng_fra_reconciliation_desc:0 "There are few who appreciate conquest. The French are no different - they too value sovereignty. But we can prove that even under the English demesne, they still have their sovereignty as Frenchmen. See to it that our possessions in France are loyal in their entirety."
 eng_one_throne_title:0 "One Throne"
 eng_one_throne_desc:0 "Abolish either the Kingdom of England or Kingdom of France. Legally, there can be only one. Temporally, there can be only one. Even metaphysically, there must only ever be one crown."
 eng_fra_embrace_renaissance_title:0 "Embrace the Renaissance"
 eng_fra_embrace_renaissance_desc:0 "The crises of the previous years can finally come to an end and a new era of prosperity awaits. Let's make the most of this new age of growth."
 eng_gbr_caribbean_title:0 "British Caribbean"
 eng_gbr_caribbean_desc:0 "As the geographical focal point of the Americas the Caribbean Islands feature some unique benefits. Some of the trade items in America can almost only be made there and the disproportionate number of potential ports can see British naval hegemony exported to its domains in America."
 eng_gbr_mexico_title:0 "Mexican Foothold"
 eng_gbr_mexico_desc:0 "A seemingly infinite amount of gold lies in the Mexican region just waiting to be excavated. We must build or conquer ports so a conquest of the region can commence."
 eng_gbr_acts_of_union_title:0 "Acts of Union"
 eng_gbr_acts_of_union_desc:0 "Scotland remains an ever-annoying pain in the side of England. See their integration into the British Kingdom and we will use the resources there to our advantage."
 eng_gbr_african_colony_title:0 "African Colony"
 eng_gbr_african_colony_desc:0 "Africa exists as a bane for sailors - making journeys between India and Europe significantly longer than they'd otherwise be. However, this landmass still contains potential use. Ivory and Gold among other valuable exports can be found here, incentivizing colonial powers to conquer."
 eng_gbr_trade_ivory_coast_title:0 "Ivory Coast Trade"
 eng_gbr_trade_ivory_coast_desc:0 "The Ivory Coast can be considered one of several focal points for commerce to and from the European Continent. We need to send ships and colonists there to oversee commercial hegemony in the region."
 eng_gbr_oceanian_colony_title:0 "Oceanian Colony"
 eng_gbr_oceanian_colony_desc:0 "In the southeastern corner of the maps of the world there are territories that are considered unoccupied by any notable power. When paired with rich lands nearby the directive to colonize the land becomes ever more important as the opportunity may fade in time."
 eng_take_ceylon_title:0 "Seize Ceylon"
 eng_take_ceylon_desc:0 "Ceylon is an island with a number of useful cities located off the coast of India proper. For the aforementioned reasons we can consider it of great use to us as a naval power to secure it in advance for mainland invasions."
 eng_south_india_title:0 "Southern India"
 eng_south_india_desc:0 "South India is geographically closest to Britain by way of African sailing. It may be prudent, then, to control some of the ports there. If not as a stop for far eastern travel, then perhaps the economic potential in the region is just of too much use to pass up..."
 eng_indian_foothold_title:0 "Footholds in India"
 eng_indian_foothold_desc:0 "Now we have the beginnings of a large Indian colony, we should consider expanding its borders so that its own existence cannot be threatened by local powers. We may even be able to persuade some of the local rulers into becoming Protectorates or Princely States.."
 eng_stability_in_india_title:0 "Stability in India"
 eng_stability_in_india_desc:0 "Our network of colonies in India is vast. The problem with the status quo is that with so many people there, there is a greater potential for revolt. The administrations of these colonies must be reformed in cooperation with the government in $CAPITAL$."
 eng_take_west_india_title:0 "West Indian Conquest"
 eng_take_west_india_desc:0 "Some of the exports from the North and East of India wind up in the Western Markets. We need to control this area immediately, so the profits are ours."
 eng_northern_india_title:0 "North Indian Unity"
 eng_northern_india_desc:0 "North India possesses a vast farmland region and silk trade. Paired with the Cotton produced farther south the British Crown can acquire a great apportionment of silk textile production and exploit its monopoly for immense revenue."
 eng_sole_indian_administration_title:0 "United India"
 eng_sole_indian_administration_desc:0 "We have sizeable colonies in India. The only thing which remains now is to unite the administrations into one so management is easier for us."
 eng_east_india_title:0 "East India"
 eng_east_india_desc:0 "East India contains sizeable opportunities for an East Indian Trading Company. It has a sizeable silk export market and trading cities to pair with it. With the ever-apparent valuable nature of the Indian region we should seek ownership of these areas immediately."
 eng_central_india_title:0 "Inland India"
 eng_central_india_desc:0 "A complete consolidation of India is not possible if there is a hollowed out center on the maps. The Unity of India is imminent, and these areas will be no exception."
 eng_malacca_title:0 "Malaccan Trade"
 eng_malacca_desc:0 "A critical junction lies in the southeastern region of Asia known as Malacca. With much trade flowing in from China this region must be taken under the wing of the British Empire for our mutual benefit."
 eng_cantonese_trade_title:0 "Cantonese Trade"
 eng_cantonese_trade_desc:0 "A huge market exists in China for the export of British consumables. We have been advised to sell addictive items such as Opium to the Chinese citizenry. Build a sizeable share in the Cantonese market so we can follow this through."
 eng_chinese_trade_cities_title:0 "Chinese Trade Cities"
 eng_chinese_trade_cities_desc:0 "The Chinese seem to have made it apparent to us that their non-cooperation would not cease unless different arrangements would be made. What they did not specify is that the arrangements did not necessarily need to be in their favor..."

 #Events
 BGM_ENG_missions.1.t:0 "The Treaty of Troyes"
 BGM_ENG_missions.1.d:0 "The English Armies have decimated those of the French bad enough that the [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] was forced by [ENG.Monarch.GetName] to sign the humiliating Treaty of Troyes. The northern posessions of France have been conceded to the English."
 BGM_ENG_missions.1.a:0 "Such a disaster.."
 
 BGM_ENG_missions.2.t:0 "Diplomatic Mission from England"
 BGM_ENG_missions.2.d:0 "An envoy from one of England's most notable statesmen has petitioned for a marriage to one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s daughters. Such an arrangement would make him the heir apparent by proxy of marital relations and foreign influence. Were we not to do so, it may make England rather upset."
 BGM_ENG_missions.2.a:0 "Sanction the marriage."
 BGM_ENG_missions.2.b:0 "We will not tolerate a foreign heir!"
 
 BGM_ENG_missions.3.t:0 "John Wycliffe"
 BGM_ENG_missions.3.d:0 "John Wycliffe was an English preacher whose philosophy founded the Christian denomination of Lollardy. It contained a number of criticisms of the Catholic Church not unusual with proto-reformation and Reformationist figures, notably that the Bible should be translated from Latin into English for common use. Wycliffe would be dismissed from Oxford University for spreading these beliefs and he would eventually draw the ire of the Catholic Church itself, most notably from the Archbishop of Canterbury though he would earlier have earned their interest."
 BGM_ENG_missions.3.a:0 "Okay."

 BGM_ENG_missions.5.t:0 "The Fate of Anglo-French Relations"
 BGM_ENG_missions.5.d:0 "England is now at an impasse. There are quite a few doctrines which we can follow in future dealings with the French. If we claim the throne of France it's likely that England's government and court will move to Paris and England will adopt a number of French bureaucratic customs. Retaining the Angevin identity which the Anglo-Norman Nobility are native to would syncretize the English identity to that of the mainland French and the final option to create a strong, centralized Mainland European alliance allows us to create Great Britain."
