 fra_disallow_conscription_desc:0 "Conscription is, at the end of the day, against the principles of freedom. Needing to force a man against his will to fight for his country is a hallmark of an unpopular administration. If we are to prove superiority in all manners over our neighbors, we must establish ourselves as the preeminent military force in Europe. And in addition to this we must challenge ourselves to remain an ever-popular government so forced military service would be entirely redundant and devoid of purpose."

 fra_religious_freedom_desc:0 "For centuries the Church has not taken kindly to individuals professing their own iteration of the Christian faith. From the Waldensians to the Protestants, the Catholic Church was afforded free reign to act as they wished to supplant any potential reformation before it began in earnest. This is not fair to the common man, and we will write an amendment in the Charter of $COUNTRY$ disallowing religious persecution and the freedom of the state to prosecute religious abuse."

 fra_fate_of_faith_title:0 "Fate of Faith"
 fra_fate_of_faith_desc:0 "The question of religion in $COUNTRY$ must be answered. However easy this may seem, the context of our day makes this question surprisingly difficult to answer. The separation of Church and State sees resistance in one form or another by conservatives as well as the most ardent of Revolutionaries. For the Revolutionaries seek to impose a new faith for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen. Be it the Cult of Reason, the Supreme Being, or otherwise, we are in for a time of religious turbulence."

 fra_privatized_banking_desc:0 "The Central Bank of $COUNTRY$ must be a hybrid of a public and privately owned institution. It must be public in that it is beholden to the will of the state, but private in manners that it is beholden to the competitive edge unique to capitalism. With these two considerations in mind our government must work to pass legislation which creates a centralized, semi-private treasury."
