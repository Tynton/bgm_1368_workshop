 nap_stable_government_title:0 "Stable Government"
 nap_stable_government_desc:0 "For the politics of Naples to come under security again $MONARCH$ must act decisively to assert authority in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] government. As a consequence some time we may be able to take revenge for Hungary's plot to seize our Kingdom."
 nap_lord_of_albania_title:0 "Lord of Albania"
 nap_lord_of_albania_desc:0 "Albania, though not part of Italy, remains close in geographical ties despite also being separated by a sea barrier. Durazzo is the only city in Albania largely removed from the protective mountainous countryside which may see potential use for a fortification network. With the weakening of the Serbian State our opportunity has arisen to seize the moment and establish ourselves in the Balkans."
 nap_avenge_1350_title:0 "Avenge 1350"
 nap_avenge_1350_desc:0 "In the year 1350 Louis of Hungary made an attempt on our crown. Were it not for the Papacy and the Black Death he may full well have seen Joanna removed from office to install a personal union. God would not allow this. We are fated to exact payment from Hungary."
 nap_recover_the_piedmont_title:0 "Recover the Piedmont"
 nap_recover_the_piedmont_desc:0 "Early in Joanna's reign the cities of Asti among others in the vicinity were lost to opportunistic invasion. However with recovered stability at home we can once again redirect our efforts into undoing the injustices of the past."
 nap_papal_ties_title:0 "Papal Ties"
 nap_papal_ties_desc:0 "The Pope has proven a consistent ally and possibly the sole barrier to Joanna's disposition as monarch of Naples. It logically follows that Naples consolidates its relationship with the Papacy of its choice for its legitimation and as an example of pious Christians wherever they may be."
 nap_end_the_schism_title:0 "End the Schism"
 nap_end_the_schism_desc:0 "The long term struggle between Avignon and Rome reached a head. The Roman Catholics certainly did not appreciate the movement of the Papal seat to Avignon and elected their own pope. Now it seems the matters of the Papacy and Naples have grown complicated somewhat. We now need to pick a side and stick with it."
 nap_ligurian_control_title:0 "Ligurian Control"
 nap_ligurian_control_desc:0 "The authority over the Piedmont demands we bring it in with control over Liguria to establish a prominent northern coastline to our Italianate exclave. These two regions are to be intimately linked as a consequence and the disparate fiefdoms of these areas are to be united under the banner of the Angevins in Naples."
 nap_land_of_italian_poets_title:0 "Land of Poets"
 nap_land_of_italian_poets_desc:0 "In recent memory the great city of Florence has known its share of household names like Alighieri but also others like Petrarch and an acceleration in scientific progress. It would be such a damn shame to let this flowering new artistic community go to waste."
 nap_emilia_romagna_title:0 "Lombardy and Romagna"
 nap_emilia_romagna_desc:0 "Milan remains one of the greater hegemons of Northern Italy. Seeing its downfall will ensure us the undisputed designation as the preeminent authority in Italy."
 nap_italian_powerhouse_title:0 "Italian Powerhouse"
 nap_italian_powerhouse_desc:0 "The claimants to the Kingdom of Naples lie in France. They want a union with us so bad, so who would we be to not oblige?"
 nap_the_french_union_title:0 "The French Union"
 nap_the_french_union_desc:0 "The Kingdom of France lay weakened. If they wish to remain independent, we cannot guarantee success for them. We will however guarantee their continued subordination."
 nap_lands_of_greece_title:0 "Lands of Hellas"
 nap_lands_of_greece_desc:0 "The Grecian lands were once home to the peoples considered so great they were elevated as equals in Roman eyes. Even part of the Latin vocabulary owes its origins to Ancient Greece. However these people may be misguided from a religious angle. We can once again unite these people under our domain as benevolent overlords seeking to once again build a powerful, prosperous empire."
 nap_the_latin_empire_title:0 "The Latin Empire"
 nap_the_latin_empire_desc:0 "The Latin Empire lived an all-too-short life. Thus, with our intervention, we can restore it to its rightful place and perhaps the old schism separating the Catholic and Orthodox churches may be on the way to being healed in earnest. For now though we have resecured Constantinople, one of the great cities of Christendom. May unity be restored once again in the eastern lands."
 nap_rule_bosnia_title:0 "Ruler of Bosnia"
 nap_rule_bosnia_desc:0 "This minor state remains a geographical obstacle for our designs in Hungary. See to it that Bosnia is secured under Neapolitan authority."
 nap_crush_serbia_title:0 "Crush Serbia"
 nap_crush_serbia_desc:0 "This empire of upstarts remained under mismanagement and stagnation for the longest time. Now we should put it out of its misery; it will join the enlightened government of Naples as one of its subordinates."
 nap_bulgarian_control_title:0 "Bulgarian Control"
 nap_bulgarian_control_desc:0 "To consolidate and convenience the Neapolitan economy it's logical then that the Bulgarian region come under our control. With so little resistance likely, it is our duty to see their control from a Christian power over an Islamic one."
 nap_anatolian_coastline_title:0 "Anatolian Coastline"
 nap_anatolian_coastline_desc:0 "We have control of Constantinople. But the coastlines of the once-Greek areas of Anatolia are still not under our dominion. If we are to once again lay claim to Jerusalem in earnest we should establish a land connection between the Balkans and the Levant."
 nap_king_of_jerusalem_title:0 "King of Jerusalem"
 nap_king_of_jerusalem_desc:0 "We can trace direct control from the city of Jerusalem to our European holdings. More importantly though the Neapolitan crusades have proven successful where others have failed. Once again and for the long term, the Holy City is now ours, as it always should have been."
 nap_the_holy_cities_title:0 "The Holy Cities"
 nap_the_holy_cities_desc:0 "It is time to cement control over Antioch and Jerusalem. With stability at home and unrest reduced abroad the colonization of these areas can begin, where Christians will be invited from across the Neapolitan domains to visit and reside in the long lost Christian holy cities. And may the Great Schism be healed in earnest once more."
 
 nap_endorsement_renaissance_title:0 "Endorse the Renaissance"
 nap_endorsement_renaissance_desc:0 "Notable poets in the North of Italy - notably Tuscany - have came to prominence in the public eye. One may consider us envious of this. But our envy will be our motivation to strive for greater heights than them."
 nap_lecce_center_title:0 "Growth of Lecce"
 nap_lecce_center_desc:0 "The center of Lecce contains a trade center for commerce from the Near East to Europe proper. Since it's a geographically central part of the Mediterranean we should perhaps attempt to facilitate its growth..."
 nap_large_naples_title:0 "Preeminent City"
 nap_large_naples_desc:0 "For centuries the North of Italy thrived while the southern would be hard pressed to be afforded enough prosperity to see urbanization on a meaningful scale. Now, though, this will be turned around. The cities of Southern Italy will know themselves to be the greatest ports in the region and perhaps grow a reputation beyond Italy itself."
 nap_apulian_ports_title:0 "Apulian Ports"
 nap_apulian_ports_desc:0 "The rearward part of the 'boot' of Italy is host to a region of cities with terrain favorable to urban development. Well, we should not wait. Waiting means we cannot manifest these areas into the best they can be as soon as such is possible."
 nap_undo_the_embarrassment_title:0 "Undo the Embarrassment"
 nap_undo_the_embarrassment_desc:0 "In the late thirteenth century Sicily was lost to us by a pretender seeking control of the Neapolitan Kingdom. This cannot stand, the Kingdom of Sicily will be reunited with the crown of Naples."
 nap_primacy_of_palermo_title:0 "Primacy of Palermo"
 nap_primacy_of_palermo_desc:0 "Despite not being placed on Italy Proper, Palermo still remained at the heart of Italy's greatest Kingdom, that of Sicily. It did not answer to the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and for quite some time the Angevin Dynasty ruled it with Naples together. For the Glory of the Old Days, let us pretend the Vespers never happened."
 nap_prosperity_of_the_holy_cities_title:0 "Holy Cities' Prosperity"
 nap_prosperity_of_the_holy_cities_desc:0 "The prosperity of the Holy Cities is paramount should we seek to complete the conversion of the heathens in the neighboring lands. These cities will be fortresses which spread light into the darkness of the neighboring territories."

 BGM_NAP_missions.1.t:0 "The Assassination of Joanna I"
 BGM_NAP_missions.1.d:0 "Mismanagement of the realm has brought intrigues from within and without together. A new claimant of the Anjou dynasty has brought together support for himself and managed to launch a coup in Naples. Joanna now remains in prison but as a potential threat to the new King, her days are most likely numbered."

A new claimant of the Anjou dynasty has brought together support for himself and managed to launch a coup in Naples. Joanna now remains in prison but as a potential threat to the new King, her days are most likely numbered."
 BGM_NAP_missions.2.a:0 "We must institute the patronage of poets in Naples."
 BGM_NAP_missions.2.b:0 "The beauty of Florence is unmatched..."

 BGM_NAP_missions.3.t:0 "The Latin Empire"
 BGM_NAP_missions.3.d:0 "The revitalized security of Constantinople under the Neapolitan statehood has brought about a complicated question with a few answers. The establishment of the Latin Empire may be viewed with distrust among the locals but may earn us beneficial relations with the Papacy. On the other hand we could retain the city directly and some of its resources be brought back to Naples."
