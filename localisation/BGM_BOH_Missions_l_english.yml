 boh_invade_brandenburg_title:0 "Invade Brandenburg"
 boh_invade_brandenburg_desc:0 "The Wittelsbachs have tried time and time again to unseat the house of Luxemburg to proclaim themselves the Emperors of Rome once again. It is time to send a message. Aggression will not be tolerated."
 boh_uncover_the_plot_title:0 "Uncover the Plot"
 boh_uncover_the_plot_desc:0 "As we may have feared, the Wittelsbachs conspired with the Polish and Hungarians to place themselves back on the Imperial Throne once again. The deposition of Bohemia cannot be tolerated. They too must be brought to heel."
 boh_hungarian_union_title:0 "Hungarian Union"
 boh_hungarian_union_desc:0 "The royal house of Bohemia now controls the Carpathian state. Now it is purely a matter of confirming long-form control over the area as Bohemian rule becomes normalized over time."
 boh_polish_union_title:0 "Subjugation of Poland"
 boh_polish_union_desc:0 "Poland no longer remains the ephemeral threat it once was. The Piast claims to Silesia cannot be acted upon now they are removed from their largest power base. For peace of mind, we will consolidate $DYNASTY$ rule in Poland."
 boh_imperial_diplomacy_title:0 "Imperial Diplomacy"
 boh_imperial_diplomacy_desc:0 "The electors are essential for Bohemia's continued control over the Holy Roman Empire. Maintaining diplomatic channels with these countries is, as such, expected of us."
 boh_imperial_bureaucrats_title:0 "Imperial Bureaucrats"
 boh_imperial_bureaucrats_desc:0 "We have accumulated a significant amount of Imperial Authority. Promulgating the administrators trained in the Charles University will prove useful in centralizing control over the Empire in due time."
 boh_primacy_of_prague_title:0 "Primacy of Prague"
 boh_primacy_of_prague_desc:0 "Of all the cities in Bohemia none retain as much splendor as Prague itself. Its central position and great farmland landscape surrounded by the mountains bordering Bohemia proper make this city a potential spot for a prosperous people."
 boh_agriculture_title:0 "Agricultural Efficiency"
 boh_agriculture_desc:0 "The Czech countryside is unique compared to its neighboring contemporaries in that it produces much in the way of food exports. This may not appear of much use on the surface but when one accounts for this being the principal reason large well fed armies exist it becomes a commodity of higher value than even gold in the right conditions."
 boh_prague_university_title:0 "University of Prague"
 boh_prague_university_desc:0 "The University of Prague, or originally Charles University, was created during the reign of Charles IV. It trained administrators for the Holy Roman Empire and the unique context means these would be niche applications. Its venues must be expanded to include more fields of study and perhaps it may evolve into an early Polytechnic."
 boh_ore_mountains_title:0 "The Ore Mountains"
 boh_ore_mountains_desc:0 "Along the northwestern border of Bohemia there are numerous silver deposits. Naturally these can be used to mint coins, but the area also hosts a defensive advantage. Perhaps we would be best to focus our efforts on both military and economic benefits while keeping taxation down?"
 boh_tax_reform_title:0 "Tax Reform"
 boh_tax_reform_desc:0 "The minting of coins in Czechia has inspired the Bohemian administration to consider an expanded reform of taxation to account for the economic inflation. If inflation is too high, the economy may worsen, increasing unrest."
 boh_imperial_banking_title:0 "Imperial Banking"
 boh_imperial_banking_desc:0 "The growth in influence from banking families in Europe sees a potential application on a grander scale if we were to leverage the state apparatus. A national bank must be created which, though owned by Bohemia, may be used by the Imperial Princes."
 
 boh_papal_relations_title:0 "Papal Relations"
 boh_papal_relations_desc:0 "It is important and within decorum for Catholic monarchs to set an example, and a good example usually means veneration of the Papacy as the utmost moral beacon in Christendom. We will maintain beneficial relations with the Papal institutions."
 boh_imperial_papacy_title:0 "Imperial Conclave"
 boh_imperial_papacy_desc:0 "One could not possibly subvert the Papacy with any means other than flattery and Papal confidence. The influence $COUNTRY$ has accumulated in the Catholic Church is significant enough we have secured the election of a new pope whose informal loyalties lie with $MONARCH$."
 boh_hussite_revolution_title:0 "The Hussite Revolution"
 boh_hussite_revolution_desc:0 "A great reformer of our day was turned into a Martyr. Jan Hus, who operated with inspiration from English reformer John Wycliffe, was tried by religious council and sentenced to death. The attention from this is spreading like wildfire and even some within the government are swayed by his demise. We are forced into a crossroads."
 
 #Hussite
 boh_mass_mobilizations_title:0 "Mass Mobilization"
 boh_mass_mobilizations_desc:0 "Threats came in from the neighboring realms that the Hussites would be executed en masse. Noting the apparent oppression the Catholic Church bestowed upon supposed 'non-believers' in recent times there is reason to believe there is credibility to this. \n\nFor this reason we must mobilize the Hussite members of society into a large military capable of fending off all of $COUNTRY$'s existential enemies."
 boh_talented_general_title:0 "Talented General"
 boh_talented_general_desc:0 "With the wars of religion the battlefields have brought upon us new talent. One such person is a layman who rose through the ranks to the top based on his talent and merit. We will need talented generals for the confrontations in the future."
 boh_war_wagons_title:0 "Develop War Wagons"
 boh_war_wagons_desc:0 "These machines would bear an interesting resemblance to modern tanks. They contained firing ports for offensive measures while retaining protection from armored cavalry attacks. Early gunpowder weapons or crossbows were most commonly used by the gunners in a war wagon."
 boh_war_wagons_manufacture_title:0 "Manufacture War Wagons"
 boh_war_wagons_manufacture_desc:0 "The materials needed to make War Wagons are many but most importantly is lumber. If we are to revolutionize warfare we will need to facilitate the mass production of War Wagons by diverting state resources to the refinement of lumber from the forests in Bohemia."
 boh_handcannons_title:0 "Hand-Cannons"
 boh_handcannons_desc:0 "Gunpowder warfare is in its infancy. This is not to mean, however, that we cannot attempt to exploit it for our needs. Rather its lack of development means there are quite a lot of potential inroads to make to military doctrine concerning the use of an alien device."
 boh_ribauldequins_title:0 "Ribauldequins"
 boh_ribauldequins_desc:0 "These multi-barreled weapons first saw use by the English in the Hundred Years' War. Firing all their projectiles at once, this weapon makes a form of primitive artillery weapon and high-powered shotgun both in one. The volume of fire these put out is quite impressive by contemporary standards, warranting a system of mass production so we can take the initiative in battlefield affairs and develop new tactics with these in mind."
 boh_formal_church_title:0 "Formalize the Church"
 boh_formal_church_desc:0 "The Hussites need an organization and a doctrine with which to unite around. Otherwise it is a disorganized mob that is easy to conquer and control. The doctrines of the first Hussite Church will be final in the lands of $COUNTRY$."
 boh_develop_alliances_title:0 "Develop Alliances"
 boh_develop_alliances_desc:0 "If we are to secure the overall success of the Hussite Reformation the creation of alliances may be imperative. A large organized Hussite bloc can prove greatly beneficial in the spreading of its ideals in Europe to overthrow the immoral Catholic Church."
 boh_forge_a_league_title:0 "Forge the League"
 boh_forge_a_league_desc:0 "The time is right to strike against the pretender Emperor. Bohemia will resecure its right to rule the Holy Roman Empire under new beliefs. The only thing which matters now is to attain considerable support within the Empire itself."
 boh_share_technology_title:0 "Shared Technology"
 boh_share_technology_desc:0 "The military developments in the Hussite Wars has brought to us an incredible amount of innovations, both material and in strategic practices. For a higher likelihood of success, our allies should also make use of these developments, irrespective of long-term consequences. The Empire is too important for us to not seek every advantage."
 
 boh_national_monarchy_title:0 "National Monarchy"
 boh_national_monarchy_desc:0 "There are many who would aspire to place a member of their dynasty on the Bohemian throne either to create a large ally or a puppet. We will prove we do not bow to foreign kings. Bohemia will create a dynasty that serves it before all else."
 boh_early_absolutism_title:0 "Early Absolutism"
 boh_early_absolutism_desc:0 "A new political dynamic appears to be gaining steam, known as Absolutism. It advocates for the unparalleled authority of a central figure, usually a King, above the other estates in his realm. If we are to ensure complete control over the Empire we should evaluate its potential application in Bohemia."
 boh_central_kingdom_title:0 "Central Kingdom"
 boh_central_kingdom_desc:0 "The unity of the Polish and Hungarian Crowns under that of the Bohemian warrants a reinvention of the Bohemian identity. The Hussite Union as one may call it will become an emergent superpower with a sufficient power base to hold its own against any threat."
 boh_hussite_enlightenment_title:0 "Bohemian Enlightenment"
 boh_hussite_enlightenment_desc:0 "The morals of Hussitism have always drifted out of the Catholic norm. This has the logical effect however on Bohemia's social identity evolving more uniqueness than other European contemporaries. A desire for liberty came rather fast as a consequence of all this and it seems a revolt may be on the horizon..."
 boh_eternal_peace_title:0 "Eternal Peace"
 boh_eternal_peace_desc:0 "With the union of the Three Crowns and internal peace in the Empire we can more or less concern ourselves with developing the economy. Only so long as $COUNTRY$ maintains a large army to ward off potential dangers can we redirect our efforts internally in earnest, however."
 
 #Catholic
 
 boh_defeat_hussites_title:0 "Defeat the Hussites"
 boh_defeat_hussites_desc:0 "Religious upstarts decided out of the blue they would attempt to overthrow the religious unity and peace uniquely afforded to the West and Central regions of Europe by Catholicism. As a display of our religious purity it is time to undo the existence of these heretics and bring them back to the fold."
 boh_affirm_religious_unity_title:0 "Affirm Religious Unity"
 boh_affirm_religious_unity_desc:0 "The tumult of previous religious uproars in Bohemia has now been brought to an end. We can prove to our peers in material form our devotion. Generations of the future will remember Bohemia for its consistent alliance with Catholic institutions."
 boh_no_heretics_title:0 "No Heretics"
 boh_no_heretics_desc:0 "It is not enough for devotees to common sense ethics to end their efforts at their country's borders. We have a duty to the Empire and to set the right example of moral purity, we will set aside the time and effort to converting the heresies within to the One True Faith."
 boh_german_laborers_title:0 "German Laborers"
 boh_german_laborers_desc:0 "There are a few reasons Bohemia might wish to seek these people out. Germany is a large and diverse place with many different economic sectors, inevitably leading to a contingent of skilled laborers which we may entice into Bohemia. There is also the rather unpopular, though inevitable, possibility that if Bohemia is to rule the Germans that at one point Bohemia would either become German, or the Germans will become Bohemian."
 boh_export_bohemian_institutions_title:0 "Export Institutions"
 boh_export_bohemian_institutions_desc:0 "In order to integrate Bohemian society into that of the greater Empire the norms and institutions which come from our country must be spread abroad by any means necessary."
 boh_develop_the_border_region_title:0 "Developed Border Region"
 boh_develop_the_border_region_desc:0 "God made the Earth and by extension Bohemia as a sort of 'fortress-land'. This is no longer necessary, for threats from the north, west, and south are now immaterial. We can develop transportation infrastructure to and from Germany through the mountain passes."
 boh_military_academies_title:0 "Military Academies"
 boh_military_academies_desc:0 "The Prague University's campuses largely concern themselves with civilian fields of study. However, the continued existence of Bohemia and the Empire at large depends on a large, competent military force."
 boh_imperial_military_title:0 "Imperial Military"
 boh_imperial_military_desc:0 "The growth of Bohemian influence in the Empire is sufficient such that we may consider a minor reform growing the forces expected to come to the duty not for the Princes but for the Empire at large."
 boh_internal_peace_title:0 "Internal Peace"
 boh_internal_peace_desc:0 "The Ewiger Landfriede guarantees internal peace. No longer will a member of the Empire shed his brother's blood. This sets in stone the future of the Empire as a large, prosperous entity with many great cities contained within."
 boh_cultural_unity_title:0 "Cultural Unity"
 boh_cultural_unity_desc:0 "The cultural prosperity and interaction between Bohemia and Germany is such that even common interactions in the Czech lands have adopted considerable German elements and vice versa. The time since this started quite a large number of generations ago means this process has seen both cultures mixed into one."
 boh_subordinate_the_estates_title:0 "Subordinate the Estates"
 boh_subordinate_the_estates_desc:0 "The Estates of Bohemia would be nothing if not an obstacle to complete control over the state apparatus. Therefore $MONARCH$ should take matters into [Root.GetHerHis] hands to revoke the privileges given to these estates and rid them of their land, for it should instead be owned by the state."
 boh_absolute_monarchy_title:0 "Authoritarianism"
 boh_absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "The path to a totalitarian state is not yet finalized. We are on the way there but there are yet still some people who wish to stand in our way..."
 boh_authoritarian_culture_title:0 "Authoritarian Culture"
 boh_authoritarian_culture_desc:0 "The successes of a state whose authority undisputably lies in one man's hands cannot be understated. The values of Enlightened Republicanism naturally erode on our borders. So long as the monarchs remain suitably competent society will forever acknowledge the institution of absolute monarchy as fair and natural."
 boh_unite_the_crowns_title:0 "Unite the Crowns"
 boh_unite_the_crowns_desc:0 "$MONARCH$ rules the disparate kingdoms of Bohemia, Poland and Hungary as three separate judicial entities. Through legal and military force we can force the union of these three realms and realize the Bohemian Commonwealth, for we are benevolent overlords."

 BGM_BOH_missions.1.t:0 "The Imperial Bank"
 BGM_BOH_missions.1.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has taken it upon himself to oversee a new financial reform, beneficial to all members of the Empire. A new Imperial Bank will be created, owned and operated by $COUNTRY$ but whose services are extended to all princes within the Holy Roman Empire. Convenient indeed, but one that which may prove detrimental to princes seeking continued sovereignty."
 BGM_BOH_missions.1.a:0 "Okay."
 
 BGM_BOH_missions.2.t:0 "Sharing of Hussite Military Technology"
 BGM_BOH_missions.2.d:0 "With the Great War to determine the religious fate of the Empire Bohemia decided it is prudent to export military technology to us to aid them. Indeed, this is the Great Struggle to decide the fate of Europe."
 BGM_BOH_missions.2.a:0 "Indeed."
 
 BGM_BOH_missions.3.t:0 "The Bohemian Revolution"
 BGM_BOH_missions.3.d:0 "The prevailing morality in Bohemia in recent times has evolved away from absolutism and in favor of personal liberties for the common citizen. Intellectuals in the major cities in and east of Bohemia have agitated the public against perceived misrule by $MONARCH$. They demand a Republic and are willing to fight for one. \n\nAn angry mob has been spearheaded by a public reformer preaching for a change in government over the past few days. Tensions have been flaring up to a degree in which the [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] is forced to meet outside of the Prague Castle to decide whether to continue his reign or surrender to the potential Revolutionaries."
 BGM_BOH_missions.3.a:0 "$MONARCH$ must resign."
 BGM_BOH_missions.3.b:0 "Our monarchy stays!"
 
 BGM_BOH_missions.4.t:0 "Fate of the Bohemian Military Academies"
 BGM_BOH_missions.4.d:0 "With wars being as frequent as they are there is reason to believe that the Bohemian military could afford to take lessons from the wars fought in Germany and elsewhere - though more the former. Our military philosophers are inconclusive as to if our military infrastructure should concern itself first and foremost with developing the Officer Corps we already have or expanding the ranks of the military overall."
 BGM_BOH_missions.4.a:0 "The Army should prioritize discipline."
 BGM_BOH_missions.4.b:0 "The Army should prioritize recruitment."

 boh_reaffirm_religious_devotion:0 "Reaffirm Religious Devotion"
 boh_reaffirm_religious_devotion_desc:0 "Forces outside Bohemia may have reason to believe heresy lingers within the noble hierarchy and potentially within the Royal Family. We can prove ourselves devout by way of engaging consistently in religious practices while furthering the goals of our chosen interpretation of Christendom."
