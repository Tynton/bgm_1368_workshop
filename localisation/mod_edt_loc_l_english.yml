 GENERIC_futurist_governments.d.1: "As per the land value taxation program, on occasion the state collects taxes and makes corrections on the aforementioned basis. Today we have finalized a new fiscal period and have calculated the revenues."
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.1.a: "Okay."
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.t.2: "Patriotic Children of the State"
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.d.2: "One important program of any futurist state is a democracy in which abolition of old traditions - marriage and family - must take place. Instead of raising children through family, the state; the nation must take the responsibility. We have raised a new nationalist generation ready to spread the nationalist, futurist cause."
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.2.a: "Wonderful."
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.t.3: "Democratic Federalization"
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.d.3: "An important policy in traditional Futurist ideology is federalization and democracy without parties. Significant power and responsibility is delegated to local governments against the centralized authority. This helps the central government in that it does not need to bear the administrative burden of its component territories."
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.3.a: "Okay."
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.t.4: "Celebration of Violence"
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.d.4: "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti wrote that his futurist ideology intends to promote violence as a purifying, hygenic force. Naturally our state must emphasize and espouse this ideal, as it is only logical that through conflict, the nation is purified of pacifistic, weakened ideology."
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.4.a: "We truly must always remain free of flaws."
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.t.5: "The Artistic State"
 GENERIC_futurist_governments.d.5: "Futurist politics expanded out from the futurist artistic movement, one of the predecessors to fascist ideology. They are incorrect to denounce Futurism as a degenerate ideology, for we are further capable of accepting that the path to progress lies not in tradition, but in youth as well as the force of violence. Our nation has produced new talented art to express our ideals to transcend language barriers and speak to the innate human."

 waldensianEvents.1.t: "The Waldensian Faith"
 waldensianEvents.1.d: "The Waldensians are a Protestant precursor movement founded by Peter Waldo in the late 12th century. Initially the Catholic Church only took issue to Waldo and his followers' not having a formal Church license for proselytizing. As time went on the rift between Waldensians and the Catholic Church grew greater until hostilities emerged that would last for centuries. Later, though, the Waldensians were mostly (though not entirely) absorbed into Protestant denominations. They were mostly secretive on the basis of religious persecution."

 waldensianEvents.1.b: "There will be permitted no perversion of Christendom."
 waldensianEvents.2.t: "Waldensian Homeland of Lyons"
 waldensianEvents.2.d: "Peter Waldo was initially a merchant based in Lyons, but he believed in voluntary poverty after a series of events in his life. He was inspired by a sermon in Saint Alexius, his rejection of Transubstantiation, and the sudden death of a friend. These convinced Waldo to live a devoted Christian life, of which he sold most of his belongings and preached his own religious interpretations."
 waldensianEvents.2.a: "Take Lyons in the name of our founder!"
 waldensianEvents.2.b: "There is no point in claiming Lyons."

 waldensianEvents.3.d: "The homeland of the Waldensian faith has been liberated! Our nation will operate as a homeland and safe haven for Waldensian Novellani and of all its followers. There is no doubt the Catholic Church will make a severe condemnation for this, but we must be prepared for a potential intervention on their part. Church property has been appropriated for the use of our new denomination."
 waldensianEvents.3.a: "We will build a lasting legacy."
 waldensianEvents.4.t: "Waldensian Church Criticizes State Wealth"
 waldensianEvents.4.d: "The Waldensians believe in voluntary poverty. While this may be the case, the Church notes that the state is a role model for its citizens and believes that by accumulating so much wealth, the Waldensians believe the state to be engaging in questionable - or immoral - activity. We don't have to abide by their terms, as we have our own projects."

 PreProtestantEvent.8.t: "Lollard Infiltration"
 PreProtestantEvent.8.d: "For as long as there have been Lollards in our nation there were nobles sympathetic to their cause. They mostly were sympathetic on the basis that they can secure another form of income from the Lollards and some other institutions like the University of Oxford in England only helped to spread the cause by forwarding it and not persecuting it."
 PreProtestantEvent.8.a: "So another province defects?"
 PreProtestantEvent.2.t: "$COUNTRY$ embraces Lollardy"
 PreProtestantEvent.2.d: "Lollards have been protected in $COUNTRY$ for long enough that they have seized considerable political power and have acted on $MONARCH$ to convert or, at the very least, allow the Lollards complete freedom. In addition some of the nobility have joined their cause and the merchant class has been split but remains mostly apathetic. The clergy, however, will be upset and will request a Papal intervention."
 PreProtestantEvent.2.a: "We must protect our cause!"
 PreProtestantEvent.3.t: "Fraticelli Infiltration"
 PreProtestantEvent.3.d: "For as long as there have been adherents to the Fraticelli in our nation they would always proselytize and forward their criticisms of the Catholic church. They believe in asceticism and humility as key causes for their heresy. Also they commonly operated out of central and southern Italy but have ventured outside the Catholic world on occasion."

 PreProtestantEvent.4.a: "We must protect our cause!"
 PreProtestantEvent.5.t: "Waldensian Infiltration"
 PreProtestantEvent.5.d: "Waldensian agents, those who claim to speak in the name of Peter Waldo, have infiltrated and subverted religious beliefs in some lands. It will take some time for them to be uprooted again, but for now we need to invest further in our inquisitions or risk falling to heresy."
 PreProtestantEvent.5.a: "So another province defects?"
 PreProtestantEvent.9.t: "The Protestant Reformation"
 PreProtestantEvent.9.d: "A new pro-reform party has taken hold near the Germanic lands. The Protestants, founded in Worms, have grown increasingly popular around the Catholic realms. Should we adopt this new religion's orthodoxy or remain as we are now?"
 PreProtestantEvent.9.a: "Join the new Reformist Orthodoxy."
 PreProtestantEvent.9.b: "Hold true to our traditions."
 PreProtestantEvent.11.t: "The Deposition of the Catholic Church"
 PreProtestantEvent.11.d: "In the year of our Lord, $YEAR$, the Roman Catholic Church has been §Rousted§! from Rome in all of its capacities. A new denomination of Christendom has taken over in that area and as catholics it is our duty to restore Rome to Papal dominion. However, there are others that seem to think that Rome's falling from the original faith gives them an opportunity to depart from the Church and join the new movements instead."
 PreProtestantEvent.11.a: "Join the new Reformist Orthodoxy."
 PreProtestantEvent.11.b: "Take Rome back and restore Christendom to what it was meant to be!"
 PreProtestantEvent.12.t: "The Conquest of Rome"
 PreProtestantEvent.12.d: "The Fraticelli have been successful in removing the impurities known as the Catholic Church from Rome. It would only be natural in these traditions that a new pope, sympathetic to this ideology be granted the seat of the former Catholic Church instead of seizing it for ourselves."
 PreProtestantEvent.12.a: "We won't answer to a pope again."
 PreProtestantEvent.12.b: "Their claim to the land is legitimate."
 PreProtestantEvent.13.t: "The Antipope"
 PreProtestantEvent.13.d: "For quite some time the Fraticelli have suffered with little foreign support outside of Naples and occasionally other cities. Now there is a sizeable nation which has embraced the One True Faith. The Fraticelli have confronted us with a request to found a sovereign entity for them to perform their work. This requires one of our cities and the surrounding area to found a base of operations."

 PreProtestantEvent.14.d: "The influence of [Root.Religion.GetName] has expanded beyond the borders of $COUNTRY$, its origin. Now $COUNTRY$ is housing reformists who wish to spread the teachings of this new denomination and topple the Roman Catholic Church. They do not intend to relent unless they are made to do so. The stage will someday be set for a religious crisis in Europe, and especially, the Holy Roman Empire may be called into question."
 PreProtestantEvent.14.a: "Oh dear"
 PreProtestantEvent.15.t: "The [Root.Religion.GetName] League"
 PreProtestantEvent.15.d: "The influence of [Root.Religion.GetName] has grown significant in the Holy Roman Empire. Recently it has came to light that the powers that follow the $RELIGION$ faith have aligned themselves together in a coalition to mandate a change of denomination in the greater Holy Roman Realm. The Emperor - as justified his terror may seem - has elected to do the same. This will ultimately create a crisis that some citizens of various realms may be surprised to know will involve the lion's share of Europe."
 PreProtestantEvent.15.a: "Oh dear"
 PreProtestantEvent.19.t: "The Fraticelli League"
 PreProtestantEvent.19.d: "Several 'anonymous' individuals have arrived in the court of $MONARCH$ to forward a strange proposition. Advocation of a dissenting movement within the Catholic Church known as the Fraticelli. They have been persecuted in Italy wherever found by the Church and have came to us with what appears to be a courier of some sort. It's most likely they came to us as we are hostile to the Petrine state in Rome. They will volunteer to proselytize the new religion in our lands if we can override the clerical institutions brought into being by the Catholic Church. In addition, they will propagandize the Fraticelli cause to the masses with the hope of inspiring new devout crusaders to overrule and defeat the false papacy."
 PreProtestantEvent.19.a: "Let us do so."
 PreProtestantEvent.19.b: "This sounds too good to be true."

 PreProtestantEvent.20.t: "THE FALL OF ROME"
 PreProtestantEvent.20.d: "The armies of $COUNTRY$ have, in tandem with religious fighters, broken through the fortifications of the Petrine statehood in Rome. They have flooded the city of Rome itself and destroyed much of the infrastructure, pillaging what they could from the citizenry. In addition to this numerous war crimes of all varieties were committed in the name of God against heresy (although this may better manifest as but a microcosm of a vendetta between the Papacy and $MONARCH$). \nThe Vatican itself was invaded and numerous artifacts were stolen, clerics were slaughtered and eventually the Pope was found. The angered crowd did not spare any clemency; he was later found dead in a manner most reminiscent of the assassination of Julius Caesar himself. \nThe news was broken to $MONARCH$ whose response was nothing short of utter glee. A new Fraticelli Pope of their choice can now be installed in the Papal capital. A new Papacy has been declared whose ideals align with the Fraticelli instead of the supposed vanity they abhor in the Roman Catholic Church. \nThese were only the matters in Rome. There is much speculation as to how this will affect the religious unity in Europe in the long term. All of the predictions fall onto a gradation between the supremacy of the Fraticelli denomination to supremacy of the Catholics. Of course the only true predictions come from biding our time... \nWhat can we truly expect from the coming centuries? One thing can be clear"
 PreProtestantEvent.20.a: "There will be a coming crisis of our day."
 COMING_CRISIS_FRAT: "§RNow Rome has fallen, Europe will eventually see a great struggle.§!"
 PreProtestantEvent.21.t: "Inspiration from the Roman Fraticellis"
 PreProtestantEvent.21.d: "Rome has fallen to the Fraticelli religious cause. Since the Pope has been our government's nemesis for some time it's logical to review the Fraticelli cause as their replacement in religious circles around $COUNTRY$. On one hand there is the risk of a moral crisis in our realm but on the other hand it is possible that we can weaken our adversaries later by forwarding the Fraticellis' newfound fame. Nevertheless, it is $MONARCH$'s choice."
 PreProtestantEvent.21.a: "We will add our ranks to the cause."
 PreProtestantEvent.21.b: "This is insanity!"
 PreProtestantEvent.22.t: "Vanity of the Nobility"
 PreProtestantEvent.22.d: "The Fraticelli Church has critiqued the Catholic precursors because they have embraced materialism in the form of physical aesthetics instead of a minimalist lifestyle, like that of Jesus. This criticism has been recently extended further by the Fraticellis to encompass the Nobility as well. They believe the Nobility should give up their materialistic outlook and embrace the ascetic existence. Naturally, though, the Nobility retaliate against this rhetoric."
 PreProtestantEvent.22.a: "The Nobility ought to be punished."
 PreProtestantEvent.22.b: "The Fraticellis have overstepped this time."

This criticism has been recently extended further by the Fraticellis to encompass the Burghers as well.

 PreProtestantEvent.24.d: "Tensions have reached another high point. The Fraticelli Church perceives the Catholics around $COUNTRY$ as a potential threat and have urged the state to begin mobilizing what is within reason. It believes there may be a potential great struggle for religious supremacy within the Catholic world and it would be foolish if not suicidal to not take our place in the upending of the supremacy of the Catholics..."

It was believed the Black Death caused the remainder of the northern territories of England to move to London. The Londoners sought to distinguish themselves from everyone else and changed their pronunciation, most notably in vowels."

 angevin.d.1: "For centuries the English people have been subject to rule by a French aristocracy. English was replacing for a long time its germanic vocabulary with words of French origin. Now it seems the residents of $PROVINCENAME$ have slowly but surely assimilated into an Anglo-Norman dialect."

 angevin.d.2: "England has fought for the right to rule France for over one hundred years. Now that not only France is vanquished but its fiefs across the land, the Angevin Empire can claim its rightful ownership of the French lands and move the capital to Paris. The question remains as to if the Royal Court will maintain its Norman heritage or assimilate into the Paris metropolitan entirely."

 GENERIC_socialist_governments.d.1: "Since the establishment of our state we have needed to redistribute the national wealth from those hoarding large sums of resources from the masses. Some kulaks may arise from time to time if the bureaucrats have been unable to detect and correct their abundances.

 BGM_DIPLOMACY.d.11: "Our agents have been detected by the royal guard, who have possibly hidden by coincidence. The operatives were executed brutally as a demonstration of force by the enemy. They are most likely going to direct their anger at us and we should be prepared for war!"

Issues such as the materialism in the Catholic Church and the reverence of artifacts of Christ's suffering were centerpieces. The aforementioned Catholics were banished but not until after arguments with our own church officials. Their anger has spilled into the neighboring powers and we should consider addressing the issue."

 space_probe_flyby.d.1: "As the satellite program in $COUNTRY$ has grown in both funding and knowledge, as well as confidence, so has the ambition. We have successfully flown a probe past Mars and have imaged it and will continue studying it for quite a while longer. It may take generations before we have exhausted all potential exploratory gain from this world. But scientists believe Mars to be the easiest in-solar system candidate for terraformation, something that could be considered later in the future."
 space_probe_flyby.1.a: "We are but one step closer to the stars."
 space_probe_flyby.n.2: "Venus Flyby"
 space_probe_flyby.d.2: "Mars was the first logical consideration for a probe flyby. Now we should turn our attention inward, to Venus. Although it is the most inhospitable terrestrial planet in the solar system, it still holds significance. For one, its day is comparable in timespan to its year, its lower atmosphere contains caustic material and its surface is the hottest in the solar system. To colonize Venus we should master the art of unconventional space technology, a true mastery to attain."
 space_probe_flyby.2.a: "Perhaps the Unconventional yields one secret to mastering the void."
 space_probe_flyby.n.3: "Mercury Flyby"
 space_probe_flyby.d.3: "To yet our most distant exploration from the Earth - but not the most distant possibility. Mercury, the first planet in the solar system with a year of only under three months and without atmosphere, is also most reminescent to the Moon around the homeworld. Its daytime is exceptionally hot but its nighttime surface is quite cool. Some could consider Mercury the blandest planet in the solar system but there are some that can find beauty in it nevertheless."

 space_probe_flyby.d.4: "The Colossal, most masculine object in the solar system, Jupiter. It prevents the formation of a terrestrial planet between Mars and itself due to its impeding gravitational field. It brings with it a concubine of moons. Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto are simply the primary Galilean moons but there are many captured asteroids orbiting the solar titan. Also accompanying Jupiter are dark rings and a number of storm systems, most notably the Great Red Spot, an extraterrestrial hurricane noted as far back as even Galileo himself. Now we can explore this mysterious world and unfold the secrets of what may be the most curious planet we currently know near us."

 space_probe_flyby.n.5: "Saturn Flyby"
 space_probe_flyby.d.5: "After Jupiter our probes drift outward to Saturn. It has the most rounded moons of any object in the solar system, from Mimas to Titan - the most exotic moon we know - to Iapetus, and much like Jupiter it carries an army of minor moons both within its vast rings and in its general gravitational influence. Unlike Jupiter its surface appears much smoother with less noticeable cloud bands."

 space_probe_flyby.6.a: "A blue titan of a world, a homage to the oceans of Earth."
 space_probe_flyby.n.7: "Neptune Flyby"
 space_probe_flyby.d.7: "Neptune, a perhaps surreal planet in some form. Its winds are the strongest around despite being the furthest from the Sun. Normally the cold would not allow pressure gradients that would generate the violent winds we're detecting, so a source of heat must be coming from within. Its rings have only now been discovered as was the case with Uranus. The rings are merely small, light-absorbing low albedo asteroids from what we could only guess was a moon passing within the Roche limit - a limit for a large (relatively) object to pass through before it rotates too quickly and breaks apart as a consequence."
 space_probe_flyby.7.a: "It is strangely reminescent of a star - with its internal heat outmatching the heat from the Sun, though distant."
 space_probe_flyby.n.8: "Solar Exit"
 space_probe_flyby.d.8: "Our probe has left Neptune and the Solar System. It now travels toward the Oort cloud and has several generations of power remaining. There will be some time to make discoveries, but by the time our probe reaches another solar system, it will be a relic of an ancient, long gone past for another civilization. It's a pessimistic assumption, but the other possibility is that it may be retrieved by humans later on and recovered for what it was known for. Things like the Golden Record may be deciphered by extraterrestrial life at some time givne the appropriate technology and interpretation mechanisms."
 space_probe_flyby.8.a: "Fly, fly, traverse the stars as humans since time immemorial always had desired!"

 westeurope.d.2: "A resurgence of liberal ideas has taken hold in our nation - most likely as a result of a neighboring force. Irrespective of old illusions regarding the Revolution, this has brought a new age with it. Laborers are yet again disgruntled. In fact because of the Revolution, even more so than before. The demands of an ever-changing society are placing weight on our state and we have to address the issues lest they get out of hand."

 westeurope.d.9: "It would appear until now we were confident that the Revolution may subside and we would take ideas as we wished from their creation. This does not seem to be the case; intelligence around Europe suggests another wave of revolutions..a climax, if one will, is upon us. The Revolutionaries seem to be breaking into radicalized and moderate paths. Advocates for advanced peasant-ran states run amok around Europe, wreaking havoc where they please to the Ancien Regime. Moderates seek to unite nations under nationalist, democratic parties. The political landscape of Europe is inevitably going to be irreversibly changed. And perhaps not just Europe, but the geopolitics of the entire planet are most likely to be alterred immensely. Conservatives, Liberals, Radicals - they may be guaranteed to fight a war against each other eventually. It would be best to avoid it. No matter who we choose, large factions in our nation will be most upset. Who will we side with?"
 westeurope.9.a: "Uh oh.."
 INDUSTRIAL_REVOLUTION_EVENTS.t.1: "Demand for Parliamentary Representation"
 INDUSTRIAL_REVOLUTION_EVENTS.d.1: "Something which became more common over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries - especially with the advent of things such as the American and French Republics, was the revolutionary concept of parliamentarism. Though parliamentarism has been around in one form or another for nearly as long as civilization, enlightenment philosophers popularized it throughout the 1600's and 1700's. It became commonplace as more countries expanded their influences and through conquest, and yielded many new republics in their wakes."

 INDUSTRIAL_REVOLUTION_EVENTS.1.b: "We will not yield to the revolutionaries."
 INDUSTRIAL_REVOLUTION_EVENTS.t.2: "The Revolutions of 1848"

 meiji.d.1: "The Westernization of Japan, or the Meiji Restoration, was a turbulent period in Japanese history of liberalization. The Samurai and the Shogunate are to be removed from prominence in society, to make way for a public mass army. A Constitution and Human Rights are to be implemented in our realm."
 meiji.1.a: "We must begin a transition; Japan must be reborn."
 meiji.1.b: "Never will Japan become corrupted by the foreigner."
 meiji.n.2: "Importation of Foreign Technology"
 meiji.d.2: "An aspect of Westernization is to import technological innovations from the Europeans. This will contribute to social issues in our society but we feel that it will be worth it in the long run. The alienation of the Samurai and Shogunate may be necessary for our long term benefit."
 meiji.2.a: "There will be a renaissance."

 tradegoods.d.5: "As technology improves, so will the demand for unique sources of power. One of which is Coal.

 tradegoods.5.a: "Wonderful."
 tradegoods.n.6: "Electronics"
 tradegoods.d.6: "Computers have been around for a while in one form or another. They were previously the sizes of buildings and with the recent innovation of the Transistor, computers have since became more efficient while also shrinking in size. It's incredibly apparent that yet another new age of technological progress is dawning. This may be the final frontier of Human Technology."
 tradegoods.6.a: "Wonderful."
 tradegoods.n.7: "Industrial Refrigeration"
 tradegoods.d.7: "Previously, Salt has been used as the main preservative of choice. Drying food has been the key manner through which preservation had been acquired. Now, through new methods of cooling, salt is no longer as useful as it once was. Meat shops now contain their products in refrigerators and can sell in higher quantities for higher prices."
 tradegoods.7.a: "Wonderful."
 tradegoods.n.8: "Military Dependency for Industrial Materials"
 tradegoods.d.8: "As the Industrial Revolution accelerates, it is practically guaranteed that over time many aspects of life would change to its demand. The military is no exemption, it too has changed. The fuel of warfare is no longer simply food, but it is also coal and the black gold known to be oil. Not only this, but metals have also seen a rise in demand to create new weapons and assets of war."
 tradegoods.8.a: "Wonderful."
 tradegoods.n.9: "Modernist Architecture"
 tradegoods.d.9: "With the social aftermath of the previous years and centuries society intended to drift in many ways into a new era, a modern era. Architecture is no different, now making liberal use of glass materials in the construction of skyscrapers among other features in city centers."

Perhaps, an age of prosperity of unmatched economic potential will follow for us."
 tradegoods.11.a: "Wonderful."
 tradegoods.n.12: "The Second Industrial Revolution"
 tradegoods.d.12: "The Second Industrial Revolution occured from the late 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. Birth rates increased and as a result the demand and supply for perhaps nearly every product grew. The output of the world economy increased drastically because of assembly lines and the increasing amount of people to staff them. However, automation would threaten jobs slowly over the course of the previous century and will likely continue into the forseeable future. Nevertheless some goods' prices have risen more than others."
 tradegoods.12.a: "Wonderful."
 tradegoods.n.13: "The Cotton Gin"
 tradegoods.d.13: "Slaves in America and to a point India have been manually picking cotton seeds from the cotton itself. To filter the seeds to plant new plants, one would have to go to a lengthy tedious process. Now, like many other textile industries, a new invention has emerged. The Cotton Gin by Eli Whitney has revolutionized parts of the process of Cotton production. This will naturally reduce the demand for slaves amidst a time in which Human Rights are becoming more popular."
 tradegoods.13.a: "Wonderful."
 tradegoods.n.14: "Artificial Silks"
 tradegoods.d.14: "Synthetic fibers have been recently made which has reduced the cost of silk production. These new silks, though are not genuine silk, resemble it enough that the term 'Artificial Silk' was coined. There are several materials that would later take over from standard Nylon (Rayon and Polyester to name a few)."
 tradegoods.14.a: "Very useful."
 tradegoods.n.15: "Artificial Sweeteners"
 tradegoods.d.15: "A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy than sugar-based sweeteners, making it a zero-calorie (non-nutritive) or low-calorie sweetener. Artificial sweeteners may be derived through manufacturing of plant extracts or processed by chemical synthesis."

Meanwhile, the field of agriculture, new practices such as crop rotation and the use of enclosures have similarly increased productivity, meaning that fewer workers are needed to work the same area of land, leading many to abandon their homes and settle in the growing industrial cities.

 mil_tech_cs_3_name: "Combined Arms"
 mil_tech_cs_3_desc: "Combined arms warfare was first used in the early to mid 14th century during the Hundred Years' War by the English. It would go on to influence strategies of commanders uninterrupted from here to modernity."
 mil_tech_cs_4_name: "Steel-lathed Crossbow"
 mil_tech_cs_4_desc: "Crossbows have already been around for some time but the innovation of steel implemented into the design of some of its components meant it now possesses a higher tensile strength, allowing more effective use on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_5_name: "Gunpowder Corning"
 mil_tech_cs_5_desc: "Corning means to ground down the propellant to fine grains. Gunpowder corning allows the propellant to ignite more effectively, ensuring better battlefield performance."
 mil_tech_cs_6_name: "Indirect Warfare"
 mil_tech_cs_6_desc: "Sometimes it isn't the right call to fight the enemies' armies. Sometimes it's instead more intelligent to instead destroy the enemy's ability to maintain their war effort. The armies of the Italian states in the 14th and 15th centuries learned of this themselves."
 mil_tech_cs_7_name: "Plate Armor"
 mil_tech_cs_7_desc: "There was already an assortment of armor varieties in the thirteen-hundreds but most recently came the most protective. Plate Armor does not reduce a soldier's mobility as much as it may seem. Mobility is always of value and to sacrifice too much of it for armor-protection would not be doing one a service."
 mil_tech_cs_8_name: "Ascendancy of Polearms"
 mil_tech_cs_8_desc: "Like with many other inventions, polearms are not unique to the Middle Ages. However, warfare has evolved such that the use of polearms was considered the most intelligent choice by commanders and logisticians in an era where effective fighting range was slowly becoming more important."
 adm_tech_cs_3_name: "Three Field System"
 adm_tech_cs_3_desc: "The Three Field System is a manner of agriculture in which plants are planted in a three-year cycle. One plant variety is grown in year one, another in year two, and another one in year three. First developed in China, it would become commonplace in Europe in the Late Medieval period."
 adm_tech_cs_4_name: "Quarantine"
 adm_tech_cs_4_desc: "Quarantining sick individuals was a practice inspired from the events of the Black Death and its subsequent outbreaks. Plague Doctor protective equipment were another similarly timed invention, enabling medical personnel to interface with the infirm without risk of exposure to disease."
 adm_tech_cs_5_name: "Striking Clocks"
 adm_tech_cs_5_desc: "Striking Clocks were a method of timekeeping for a city jurisdiction. They could be engineered to strike at certain times of day but were most often noted to sound off at noon. They could sound off once an hour during the late mornings or early afternoons, in addition."
 adm_tech_cs_6_name: "Papermaking"
 adm_tech_cs_6_desc: "Papermaking is a practice initiated in China but spread to Europe through the Arabic world. It was not of too much use in Europe though until movable type came to be there, by which point paper saw immense use."
 adm_tech_cs_7_name: "Autocracy"
 adm_tech_cs_7_desc: "The political trend through the world has been to distance from feudal regimes and the social upheaval they now cause. Depending on the region the transition to despotic states may have already began or would do so by the late fifteenth century. By the sixteen-hundreds though autocratic states were the norm."
 adm_tech_cs_8_name: "Blast Furnace"
 adm_tech_cs_8_desc: "Blast furnaces are useful for the industry of metallurgy. They were not everywhere however but as needs arise, so too will the answers. Metals have been proven far superior materials for warfare for their general sturdiness. As such the demand for states to acquire the means to provide vast amounts of metals was a necessity."
 dip_tech_cs_9_name: "Post Mill"
 dip_tech_cs_9_desc: "First appearing in the twelfth century, Post Mills have seen widespread use in Europe and beyond for centuries. Initially though windmills were used for cereal grinding, splitting the grains from the wheat chaffs."
 dip_tech_cs_3_name: "Horseshoe"
 dip_tech_cs_3_desc: "Horseshoes see use in improving the distance a horse can travel. Normally the environment may compromise the hooves but the introduction of iron horseshoes now allows longer distance travel as the horseshoes themselves have to brave the elements on the ground."
 dip_tech_cs_4_name: "Interregional Commerce"
 dip_tech_cs_4_desc: "The Mongol Empire established, albeit unintentionally, a trade network between China and Europe. Though the Black Death most likely travelled along this path, so too would notable merchants such as Marco Polo and others. The Silk Road has been as such popularized as a means of importing spices from East Asia to the courts of Europe."
 dip_tech_cs_5_name: "Early Carrack"
 dip_tech_cs_5_desc: "The Galleys are good enough naval vessels for the Mediterranean but larger vessels would be needed for oceangoing travel. Enter the Carrack, a large vessel developed in Portugal and Spain for use on the high seas, and unstoppable by other ships."
 dip_tech_cs_6_name: "Mercantilism"
 dip_tech_cs_6_desc: "A Florentine philosopher has written a commercial treatise promoting mercantilism. The ideal is to minimize imports while maximizing exports, thus increasing profitability and decreasing reliance on foreign powers for access to trade items."
 dip_tech_cs_7_name: "Compass Navigation"
 dip_tech_cs_7_desc: "It was not until rather recently that compasses have seen new use as devices of waymaking. Seafaring vessel commanders will most certainly find use in this trend for more accurate navigation wherever on the Earth they may find themselves."
 dip_tech_cs_8_name: "Long-Distance Commerce"
 dip_tech_cs_8_desc: "This refers to the use of ships for long-distance travel specifically. Ships in this day and age could carry far more than most convoys on land. In addition to this, aside from pirates, there are not too many threats to a ship's voyage, unless one includes even the most remote possibility of being robbed at a harbor."
 mil_tech_cs_39_name: "Field Howitzer"
 mil_tech_cs_39_desc: "A howitzer is a type of artillery piece characterized by a relatively short barrel and the use of comparatively small propellant charges to propel projectiles over relatively high trajectories, with a steep angle of descent."
 mil_tech_cs_40_name: "Percussion-cap Weapons"
 mil_tech_cs_40_desc: "The percussion cap, introduced circa 1820, is a type of single-use ignition device used on muzzleloader firearms that enabled them to fire reliably in any weather conditions. This crucial invention gave rise to the caplock or percussion lock system."
 mil_tech_cs_41_name: "Mass Industrialization of Military Equipment"
 mil_tech_cs_41_desc: "Although military equipment has for a while been produced by factories around this time sees the regulation, standardization and proliferation of mass-production for military equipment. Guns, artillery pieces and other military hardware now can be produced en masse."
 mil_tech_cs_42_name: "Breech Loading Weapons"
 mil_tech_cs_42_desc: "Breech loading weapons have been in existence since the 14th century, but haven't been popular until recently. Breech loading weapons load their ammunition into a chamber from a latch or hatch behind the chamber, unlike muzzle loading weapons which insert a projectile from the frontal bore."
 mil_tech_cs_43_name: "Bolt-Action Rifle"
 mil_tech_cs_43_desc: "Bolt action is a type of firearm action where the handling of cartridges into and out of the weapon's barrel chamber is operated by manually manipulating the bolt directly via a handle."
 mil_tech_cs_44_name: "Long Range Artillery"
 mil_tech_cs_44_desc: "Rifled Artillery has the benefit of spinning a projectile, adding great accuracy. This also stabilizes the projectile so it does not veer off course and though this statement is a redundancy in noting its accuracy, it also improved its effective range."
 mil_tech_cs_45_name: "Trench Fortifications"
 mil_tech_cs_45_desc: "Trenches are most famously used during World War One as a reaction to the increasing firepower of modern arms, such as machine guns. Trench Warfare itself was in a strategic sense exceptionally slow, at least to change the dynamics on the frontline. It was broken when it was discovered that Battle Tanks could bypass the trenches themselves and eliminate any defenders."
 mil_tech_cs_46_name: "Armored Vehicles"
 mil_tech_cs_46_desc: "Armored Vehicles are any kind of vehicle - most notably tanks - using metallic armor plating of various types. Tankettes and Armored Cars are other types of armored vehicles, some of which barely preceded the conception of the Battle Tank in World War One."
 mil_tech_cs_47_name: "Inter-War Air Forces"
 mil_tech_cs_47_desc: "Although planes have existed since the 1900s (before 1910) as an advent of the Wright Brothers' design, they were limited to mostly a passive role as a scout vehicle. This did not stop fighter planes during World War One (most notably the Red Baron, a German pilot) from being used to shoot down enemy scouts. Also, light strategic bombers did exist as far back as the 1910s."
 mil_tech_cs_48_name: "Early Modern Tanks"
 mil_tech_cs_48_desc: "The modern conception of tanks generally includes a 420 degree rotating top-mounted turret affixed with a main cannon of at least 20mm or higher, sometimes with a coaxial machine gun mount next to it. This was not always the case with Battle Tank technology as some tanks during World War One had several turrets on the sides (see Mark tank series enumerated I-X) but some light tanks from that era had a somewhat modern design philosophy."
 mil_tech_cs_49_name: "Submachine Gun"
 mil_tech_cs_49_desc: "Submachine guns were at the time a lightweight full-automatic weapon system, the most mobile of handheld infantry weapons. Though they were in part superseded by Personal Defense Weapons and Automatic Rifles during the later stages of World War Two and beyond, they still hold their own to this day as a useful weapon of choice for various applications."
 mil_tech_cs_50_name: "Nuclear Weapons Research"
 mil_tech_cs_50_desc: "Nuclear weapons have been hypothesized even before and during World War I. H.G. Wells was interested in it and wrote "
 mil_tech_cs_51_name: "Proliferation of Jet-plane technology"
 mil_tech_cs_51_desc: "Jet planes have been around since late World War II. Turbojets (the most common type of jet engine) were invented prior to it but the war caused innovations to it for military applications. Now we are seeing the development of jet engine technology and its usage in air forces, which is most likely here to stay."
 mil_tech_cs_52_name: "Kevlar"
 mil_tech_cs_52_desc: "Kevlar (invented by Stephanie Kwolek) is a heat resistant and also strong synthetic fiber. It has been used most famously by militaries as a form of body armor but has civilian uses."
 mil_tech_cs_53_name: "Ballistic Missile Guidance"
 mil_tech_cs_53_desc: "Ballistic Missiles are long-range missiles normally used to carry nuclear warheads. They have also been used by space agencies to carry probes, astronauts and equipment to other planets and their moons."
 mil_tech_cs_54_name: "Electronic Warfare"
 mil_tech_cs_54_desc: "Electronic Warfare is the discipline of using electronic devices, both hardware and software, to undermine efforts by our enemies. They can be used both during peacetime and during war for disinformation practices."
 mil_tech_cs_55_name: "Laser-Based Missile Defense"
 mil_tech_cs_55_desc: "Although lasers have been commonly considered in science fiction as direct-fire weapons for use against both armored and unarmored targets, the issue present with it is that so far the power sources for lasers strong enough to do that do not currently exist. They can, however, be more practically used to shoot down missiles of varying degrees."
 mil_tech_cs_56_name: "Stealth Aircraft Proliferation"
 mil_tech_cs_56_desc: "Stealth aircraft have existed for a while but advancements in the technologies relating to sensory avoidance and/or deprivation have made stealth technologies more viable. This may also initiate other trends or continue existing ones, in the instances that some combat operatives prefer mobility over protection, stealth technology can also help take care of issues of protection. One does not need armor if he cannot be detected, after all."
 mil_tech_cs_57_name: "ETC Autocannon | Mobile Railgun"
 mil_tech_cs_57_desc: "Electrothermal-Chemical and Railgun technologies both are an improvement in the propulsion of projectiles over smokeless powder, among other things. Electrothermal-Chemical technology seeks to pair electricity and plasma with an explosive to better ignite the propellant in a casing for tank shells to increase velocity, thus increasing the kinetic energy contained within the projectile. With armor technology becoming rather advanced, kinetic penetrators need more velocity. In extreme cases, railguns may be of necessity."
 dip_tech_cs_39_name: "Gold Standard"
 dip_tech_cs_39_desc: "Fiat currency existed in some form as a medium of exchange for centuries but translating it into gold (adoption of the Gold Standard) wasn't done much until the 1800's as the United Kingdom was the first to implement a system, followed by many other western powers."
 dip_tech_cs_40_name: "Steel Can"
 dip_tech_cs_40_desc: "A steel can is a container for the distribution or storage of goods, made of thin metal. Many cans require opening by cutting the "
 dip_tech_cs_41_name: "Steam Engines for Ships"
 dip_tech_cs_41_desc: "Steam Engines are a new method of propulsion for seafaring vessels. They do not require a large amount of operators as raft-propelled ships do, and they do not rely solely on the wind to guide the ship along. Truly, a revolutionary invention."
 dip_tech_cs_42_name: "Ironclad"
 dip_tech_cs_42_desc: "Ironclads were the first iron hulled vessels in naval history. Because of this they were much sturdier than their counterparts and quickly became the standard for ship-of-the-line models, beginning in Britain."
 dip_tech_cs_43_name: "Oil Extraction"
 dip_tech_cs_43_desc: "Oil extraction is a process by which oil reserves are located through seismic measurement and excavated. Following the seismic analysis, a drill is used to access the oil reserves, through which it can be harvested."
 dip_tech_cs_44_name: "Early Dreadnought"
 dip_tech_cs_44_desc: "Dreadnoughts are an early form of Battleship characterized by having their arsenal completely dominated by large caliber cannons. The first ship of this type was known as the HMS Dreadnought, in service with the British Fleet in the early twentieth century. The ship would inspire development of future battleship vessels."
 dip_tech_cs_45_name: "Proliferation of Refrigeration"
 dip_tech_cs_45_desc: "Previously, all food preservation was done with salt as it dehydrated food items. Hydration is a key condition for decomposition and as such drying out meats or other consumable items was most important, especially for naval voyages. Now we do not have to concern ourselves with this as industrial technology allows us to instead freeze dietary items prior to heating and consumption."
 dip_tech_cs_46_name: "Film"
 dip_tech_cs_46_desc: "In the eighteen-nineties in Paris there was a convention for new technologies to be unveiled and one such technology was Film. Using specialized devices such as a film sheet and lighting, it is now possible to play individual frames from footage at rapid pace, enabling an illusory effect of animation. Films and hand-drawn animations would both seek inspiration from this seminal work for decades to come."
 dip_tech_cs_47_name: "Mass Communication Technology"
 dip_tech_cs_47_desc: "Communication with the masses was for the most part, historically speaking, enabled by pamphlets or newspapers. With Industrialization and its many Pandora's Boxes being opened by society, we now have a new device which can transmit audio from one source to a destination or destinations. Enter the Radio."
 dip_tech_cs_48_name: "Battleship"
 dip_tech_cs_48_desc: "Battleships retain similarities with their Dreadnought precursors. However, Battleships again diversified their arsenals between large caliber and medium caliber cannons. This diversity allowed Battleships to better adapt and engage various classifcations of targets, something Dreadnoughts would suffer in trying to do."
 dip_tech_cs_49_name: "Diplomatic Globalization"
 dip_tech_cs_49_desc: "Though the world has seen globalization for several centuries by now, nations did not always consider others from other corners of the world as equals. As the West moved toward more liberal values, things such as decolonization and the Cold War made this necessary."
 dip_tech_cs_50_name: "Early Plastics"
 dip_tech_cs_50_desc: "Plastics are synthetic materials used in many commercial products around the world today, though clearly this wasn't always the case. Plastics became more frequent sights in the mid-late 20th century after new, popular forms of plastic were invented."
 dip_tech_cs_51_name: "S.I. System"
 dip_tech_cs_51_desc: "The System International (French), or known in English as the International System was a system of units and measurements built around the base-ten Arabic numeral system which had won out over Roman numeration around the Renaissance and after. Exploiting the decimal nature of this allows mathematics to become more intuitive than it was previously, even under measurement systems like the Imperial system."
 dip_tech_cs_52_name: "Missile Ships"
 dip_tech_cs_52_desc: "Missile ships use missiles as an important armament of choice as missile guidance systems became more developed. With this increased the maximum effective range and accuracy of the ships themselves and allowed for more complicated attack patterns than their older brethren of the Battleship."
 dip_tech_cs_53_name: "Commercialized Computers"
 dip_tech_cs_53_desc: "Computing technology has existed for most of the 20th century already but developments and high prospects of the technology of information sharing have us conclude that furthering the betterment of this technological choice should be our top priority. Information dissemination and control are vital for all regimes, democratic or not."
 dip_tech_cs_54_name: "Biotechnology | Early GMOs"
 dip_tech_cs_54_desc: "Biological research has been around in its more modern incarnation since the mid-nineteenth century. Anesthesia, surgery and medicinal chemistry in a secular form had arisen since then and now we have came a long way. To a point even that directly interfacing with the most fundamental aspect of life - the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is now attainable in primitive forms in laboratories. Its first application would be seen in Genetically Modified Organisms tailored for human consumption."
 dip_tech_cs_55_name: "Internet Commercialization"
 dip_tech_cs_55_desc: "While the Semiconductor and by extension the digial computer have been around for a while already, the advent of the tools needed to create a civilian network of computers has already seen a large number of applications. Expanded socialization or access to knowledge means a responsibly handled Internet could bring about a new era of unrestricted human development. It could also be used by state or non-state actors to facilitate compliance."
 dip_tech_cs_56_name: "CRISPR Gene Augmentation"
 dip_tech_cs_56_desc: "We have stumbled across what may full well be an exceptionally valuable discovery. The E. Coli bacteria uses a gene known as CRISPR and its associated Cas9 protein as a defensive mechanism from viral infection. The RNA (or in some cases, DNA from bacteriophage viruses) is sampled and added to the E. Coli's genome. This can also be used as a gene-editing package introduced to human cells by way of a tailored virus. It is believed upwards of half of the human genome is already junk inserts from historic infections, so there is little reason to believe that utilization of the CRISPR gene in human cells is possible. The question now becomes, what will come of it?"
 dip_tech_cs_57_name: "Bioweapons | Superhumans"
 dip_tech_cs_57_desc: "The age of genetic augmentation is upon us. A new arms race between states concerns itself no longer with nuclear weapons, but instead with the creation of bioweapons and the means to counter them. For the human race, there is no reversing of the Crossing of the Rubicon. Now, it is a case of determining whether Humanity has doomed itself in doing so or if it enters an era of unprecedented expansionism in all fields, studies and indutries."
 adm_tech_cs_39_name: "Provincial Railroads"
 adm_tech_cs_39_desc: "Formerly, and for as long as human civilization has existed, there was at least a way to pass information and items along for long distances. But roads, ships and horse carriages can be slow. With coal, though, we can use trains. An industrial technology, trains have no need for food or rest. They need only coal which is a flammable solid, to turn the machinery to spin their wheels along pre-defined and constructed tracks which can run as long as is necessary."
 adm_tech_cs_40_name: "Societal Modernization"
 adm_tech_cs_40_desc: "Industrialization has brought about joblessness for many people. In addition to this, lifestyles and standards of living are in the process of changing and all of this occurring simultaneously with the spread of novel ideas culminates in unrest. Nationalism and the desire for change from feudalism to novel ideologies and institutions seeds an era of general discontent with the powers that be."
 adm_tech_cs_41_name: "Telegraphy"
 adm_tech_cs_41_desc: "Telegraphs were in the early development phase since the eighteen-thirties. They would be the first method of near-instantaneous communication between distant areas but would not see practical use in and of themselves for common citizenry, not for quite a long time anyway."
 adm_tech_cs_42_name: "Electric Lightbulb"
 adm_tech_cs_42_desc: "Gas lamps and candles, though already in widespread use, require a fuel to use. Electrical lighting however does not need this and can also be used as long as there is an electrical current. The coming decades will see a gradual shift from conventional lighting to electrical lighting for all night-time needs."
 adm_tech_cs_43_name: "Propagation of Electric Appliances"
 adm_tech_cs_43_desc: "This time sees the expansion of large-scale power stations to feed society's growing demand for electrical power. Although the aforementioned lightbulb needs electrical power, other inventive minds have created devices which can provide or consume electrical power, and/or both."
 adm_tech_cs_44_name: "Airplane"
 adm_tech_cs_44_desc: "Human attempts to take flight have been recorded as far back at least as Leonardo da Vinci in the Renaissance. However, none of these attempts would work as they would at most serve as gliders. Propulsive power is vital for long-term flight and now we can mount engines and propellers to manipulate the air to generate thrust. Long form flight is now attainable thanks to the merging of these technologies known as the air plane."
 adm_tech_cs_45_name: "Aluminium Smelting"
 adm_tech_cs_45_desc: "Aluminium is a light elemental material which has found use in applications requiring lightweight materials. Planes and cans both are notable uses of this material."
 adm_tech_cs_46_name: "Revanchist Politics"
 adm_tech_cs_46_desc: "As society proceeds ever forth, there are souls that long for the past. For a time which we were great. Recent times have exacted an unjust robbery of our pride and prestige and now we must look to new individuals and movements to recover it."
 adm_tech_cs_47_name: "Authoritarian Innovation"
 adm_tech_cs_47_desc: "In recent times a rise in the number of authoritarian or totalitarian states mandates the growth of the administration to be able to peer into the lives of their constituent citizens. Innovativeness in this aspect is much required and it is the states' responsibility to ensure good behavior in their citizens. After all, dissidence creates disasters."
 adm_tech_cs_48_name: "Early Decolonization Age"
 adm_tech_cs_48_desc: "The social shock in the years past from colossal confrontations and mass death requires society to review its morality. Should we doom young men to die who would have otherwise lived productive lives?"
 adm_tech_cs_49_name: "Nuclear Power Plant"
 adm_tech_cs_49_desc: "Nuclear technologies don't always need to have destructive use. The energy released from fission reactions can easily make uranium a viable power source for our nation's communities."
 adm_tech_cs_50_name: "Color Television"
 adm_tech_cs_50_desc: "RGB color definitions emerged in the 1950s-1960s as Cathode-Ray Tube television screens. In 1954 the first CRT television was designed but grayscale would remain the norm until the 1960s when many televised programs transitioned to color."
 adm_tech_cs_51_name: "FG-MOSFET Transistor"
 adm_tech_cs_51_desc: "Transistors are extremely common in modern computers but were pioneered and developed in the 1950s-1970s. FG-MOSFETs are commonly used as a floating-gate memory cell, the digital storage element in EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory technologies."
 adm_tech_cs_52_name: "Early Space Age"
 adm_tech_cs_52_desc: "Satellites and humans may have been launched into space already, but we are confident that this is only the beginning. Inspired by these, authors and filmmakers are interested in exploiting these developments for profit. We see their opportunities as our own; let us motivate the people to support space expeditions."
 adm_tech_cs_53_name: "Modern Administration"
 adm_tech_cs_53_desc: "Data entry into computers makes many things much easier. The ease at which errors can be accounted for and corrected no longer requires things like erasers or whiteout but a simple press of a few keys. Administrating has never been easier."
 adm_tech_cs_54_name: "Gen III Nuclear Reactor"
 adm_tech_cs_54_desc: "Generation III Nuclear Reactors are different from Generation II in the advancement and redundancy of safety measures. Nuclear disasters in the years past have raised awareness in the public eye and fear of nuclear contamination or other dangers related to it mean the nuclear industry is under high levels of supervision for fear another safety mishap may cause a large crisis."
 adm_tech_cs_55_name: "Internet"
 adm_tech_cs_55_desc: "While the Semiconductor and by extension the digial computer have been around for a while already, the advent of the tools needed to create a civilian network of computers has already seen a large number of applications.

It could also be used by state or non-state actors to facilitate compliance."
 adm_tech_cs_56_name: "Mobile Devices | Internet of Things"
 adm_tech_cs_56_desc: "Phones have became something of a right of passage to adulthood in the eyes of the common citizen, knowingly or otherwise. It is a great responsibility from their perspective given the expense to acquire one. However, citizens may be sometimes responsible with the handling of their devices, but are they responsible with its usage?"
 adm_tech_cs_57_name: "Space Travel Commercialization"
 adm_tech_cs_57_desc: "Space travel has been in its times of naissance a purely exploratory endeavor. One would be mistaken in assuming it was purely an exploration of the Universe around the Earth in earnest. It was also an exploration in the techniques and methods of navigating space as well as the engineering process to design the vehicles for such journeys. Now the methods are refined, we must refine the engineering for the economy's sake. A new renaissance may soon bless us as we can tap into the economic potential of celestial bodies such as the Moon and beyond."

The Tuileries Palace would be a notable site during the French Revolution as Louis XVI resided there as he was made to by the Revolutionaries. Later, it would be a residence for Napoleon while Emperor of the French and shortly before, as Consul. \n\nThe Garden was also a playground for the Dauphin and after the fall of the Kingdom to the Republic the Tuileries Garden became a public venue."

 boh_invade_brandenburg_desc: "The Wittelsbachs have tried time and time again to unseat the house of Luxemburg to proclaim themselves the Emperors of Rome once again. It is time to send a message. Aggression will not be tolerated."
 boh_uncover_the_plot_title: "Uncover the Plot"
 boh_uncover_the_plot_desc: "As we may have feared, the Wittelsbachs conspired with the Polish and Hungarians to place themselves back on the Imperial Throne once again. The deposition of Bohemia cannot be tolerated. They too must be brought to heel."
 boh_hungarian_union_title: "Hungarian Union"
 boh_hungarian_union_desc: "The royal house of Bohemia now controls the Carpathian state. Now it is purely a matter of confirming long-form control over the area as Bohemian rule becomes normalized over time."
 boh_polish_union_title: "Subjugation of Poland"
 boh_polish_union_desc: "Poland no longer remains the ephemeral threat it once was. The Piast claims to Silesia cannot be acted upon now they are removed from their largest power base. For peace of mind, we will consolidate $DYNASTY$ rule in Poland."
 boh_imperial_diplomacy_title: "Imperial Diplomacy"
 boh_imperial_diplomacy_desc: "The electors are essential for Bohemia's continued control over the Holy Roman Empire. Maintaining diplomatic channels with these countries is, as such, expected of us."
 boh_imperial_bureaucrats_title: "Imperial Bureaucrats"
 boh_imperial_bureaucrats_desc: "We have accumulated a significant amount of Imperial Authority. Promulgating the administrators trained in the Charles University will prove useful in centralizing control over the Empire in due time."
 boh_primacy_of_prague_title: "Primacy of Prague"
 boh_primacy_of_prague_desc: "Of all the cities in Bohemia none retain as much splendor as Prague itself. Its central position and great farmland landscape surrounded by the mountains bordering Bohemia proper make this city a potential spot for a prosperous people."
 boh_agriculture_title: "Agricultural Efficiency"
 boh_agriculture_desc: "The Czech countryside is unique compared to its neighboring contemporaries in that it produces much in the way of food exports. This may not appear of much use on the surface but when one accounts for this being the principal reason large well fed armies exist it becomes a commodity of higher value than even gold in the right conditions."
 boh_prague_university_title: "University of Prague"
 boh_prague_university_desc: "The University of Prague, or originally Charles University, was created during the reign of Charles IV. It trained administrators for the Holy Roman Empire and the unique context means these would be niche applications. Its venues must be expanded to include more fields of study and perhaps it may evolve into an early Polytechnic."
 boh_ore_mountains_title: "The Ore Mountains"
 boh_ore_mountains_desc: "Along the northwestern border of Bohemia there are numerous silver deposits. Naturally these can be used to mint coins, but the area also hosts a defensive advantage. Perhaps we would be best to focus our efforts on both military and economic benefits while keeping taxation down?"
 boh_tax_reform_title: "Tax Reform"
 boh_tax_reform_desc: "The minting of coins in Czechia has inspired the Bohemian administration to consider an expanded reform of taxation to account for the economic inflation. If inflation is too high, the economy may worsen, increasing unrest."
 boh_imperial_banking_title: "Imperial Banking"
 boh_imperial_banking_desc: "The growth in influence from banking families in Europe sees a potential application on a grander scale if we were to leverage the state apparatus. A national bank must be created which, though owned by Bohemia, may be used by the Imperial Princes."
 boh_papal_relations_title: "Papal Relations"
 boh_papal_relations_desc: "It is important and within decorum for Catholic monarchs to set an example, and a good example usually means veneration of the Papacy as the utmost moral beacon in Christendom. We will maintain beneficial relations with the Papal institutions."
 boh_imperial_papacy_title: "Imperial Conclave"
 boh_imperial_papacy_desc: "One could not possibly subvert the Papacy with any means other than flattery and Papal confidence. The influence $COUNTRY$ has accumulated in the Catholic Church is significant enough we have secured the election of a new pope whose informal loyalties lie with $MONARCH$."
 boh_hussite_revolution_title: "The Hussite Revolution"
 boh_hussite_revolution_desc: "A great reformer of our day was turned into a Martyr. Jan Hus, who operated with inspiration from English reformer John Wycliffe, was tried by religious council and sentenced to death. The attention from this is spreading like wildfire and even some within the government are swayed by his demise. We are forced into a crossroads."
 boh_mass_mobilizations_title: "Mass Mobilization"
 boh_mass_mobilizations_desc: "Threats came in from the neighboring realms that the Hussites would be executed en masse. Noting the apparent oppression the Catholic Church bestowed upon supposed 'non-believers' in recent times there is reason to believe there is credibility to this. \n\nFor this reason we must mobilize the Hussite members of society into a large military capable of fending off all of $COUNTRY$'s existential enemies."
 boh_talented_general_title: "Talented General"
 boh_talented_general_desc: "With the wars of religion the battlefields have brought upon us new talent. One such person is a layman who rose through the ranks to the top based on his talent and merit. We will need talented generals for the confrontations in the future."
 boh_war_wagons_title: "Develop War Wagons"
 boh_war_wagons_desc: "These machines would bear an interesting resemblance to modern tanks. They contained firing ports for offensive measures while retaining protection from armored cavalry attacks. Early gunpowder weapons or crossbows were most commonly used by the gunners in a war wagon."
 boh_war_wagons_manufacture_title: "Manufacture War Wagons"
 boh_war_wagons_manufacture_desc: "The materials needed to make War Wagons are many but most importantly is lumber. If we are to revolutionize warfare we will need to facilitate the mass production of War Wagons by diverting state resources to the refinement of lumber from the forests in Bohemia."
 boh_handcannons_title: "Hand-Cannons"
 boh_handcannons_desc: "Gunpowder warfare is in its infancy. This is not to mean, however, that we cannot attempt to exploit it for our needs. Rather its lack of development means there are quite a lot of potential inroads to make to military doctrine concerning the use of an alien device."
 boh_ribauldequins_title: "Ribauldequins"
 boh_ribauldequins_desc: "These multi-barreled weapons first saw use by the English in the Hundred Years' War. Firing all their projectiles at once, this weapon makes a form of primitive artillery weapon and high-powered shotgun both in one. The volume of fire these put out is quite impressive by contemporary standards, warranting a system of mass production so we can take the initiative in battlefield affairs and develop new tactics with these in mind."
 boh_formal_church_title: "Formalize the Church"
 boh_formal_church_desc: "The Hussites need an organization and a doctrine with which to unite around. Otherwise it is a disorganized mob that is easy to conquer and control. The doctrines of the first Hussite Church will be final in the lands of $COUNTRY$."
 boh_develop_alliances_title: "Develop Alliances"
 boh_develop_alliances_desc: "If we are to secure the overall success of the Hussite Reformation the creation of alliances may be imperative. A large organized Hussite bloc can prove greatly beneficial in the spreading of its ideals in Europe to overthrow the immoral Catholic Church."
 boh_forge_a_league_title: "Forge the League"
 boh_forge_a_league_desc: "The time is right to strike against the pretender Emperor. Bohemia will resecure its right to rule the Holy Roman Empire under new beliefs. The only thing which matters now is to attain considerable support within the Empire itself."
 boh_share_technology_title: "Shared Technology"
 boh_share_technology_desc: "The military developments in the Hussite Wars has brought to us an incredible amount of innovations, both material and in strategic practices. For a higher likelihood of success, our allies should also make use of these developments, irrespective of long-term consequences. The Empire is too important for us to not seek every advantage."
 boh_national_monarchy_title: "National Monarchy"
 boh_national_monarchy_desc: "There are many who would aspire to place a member of their dynasty on the Bohemian throne either to create a large ally or a puppet. We will prove we do not bow to foreign kings. Bohemia will create a dynasty that serves it before all else."
 boh_early_absolutism_title: "Early Absolutism"
 boh_early_absolutism_desc: "A new political dynamic appears to be gaining steam, known as Absolutism. It advocates for the unparalleled authority of a central figure, usually a King, above the other estates in his realm. If we are to ensure complete control over the Empire we should evaluate its potential application in Bohemia."
 boh_central_kingdom_title: "Central Kingdom"
 boh_central_kingdom_desc: "The unity of the Polish and Hungarian Crowns under that of the Bohemian warrants a reinvention of the Bohemian identity. The Hussite Union as one may call it will become an emergent superpower with a sufficient power base to hold its own against any threat."
 boh_hussite_enlightenment_title: "Bohemian Enlightenment"
 boh_hussite_enlightenment_desc: "The morals of Hussitism have always drifted out of the Catholic norm. This has the logical effect however on Bohemia's social identity evolving more uniqueness than other European contemporaries. A desire for liberty came rather fast as a consequence of all this and it seems a revolt may be on the horizon..."
 boh_eternal_peace_title: "Eternal Peace"
 boh_eternal_peace_desc: "With the union of the Three Crowns and internal peace in the Empire we can more or less concern ourselves with developing the economy.

 boh_defeat_hussites_title: "Defeat the Hussites"
 boh_defeat_hussites_desc: "Religious upstarts decided out of the blue they would attempt to overthrow the religious unity and peace uniquely afforded to the West and Central regions of Europe by Catholicism.

 boh_no_heretics_desc: "It is not enough for devotees to common sense ethics to end their efforts at their country's borders. We have a duty to the Empire and to set the right example of moral purity, we will set aside the time and effort to converting the heresies within to the One True Faith."
 boh_german_laborers_title: "German Laborers"
 boh_german_laborers_desc: "There are a few reasons Bohemia might wish to seek these people out. Germany is a large and diverse place with many different economic sectors, inevitably leading to a contingent of skilled laborers which we may entice into Bohemia. There is also the rather unpopular, though inevitable, possibility that if Bohemia is to rule the Germans that at one point Bohemia would either become German, or the Germans will become Bohemian."
 boh_export_bohemian_institutions_title: "Export Institutions"
 boh_export_bohemian_institutions_desc: "In order to integrate Bohemian society into that of the greater Empire the norms and institutions which come from our country must be spread abroad by any means necessary."

 boh_develop_the_border_region_desc: "God made the Earth and by extension Bohemia as a sort of 'fortress-land'. This is no longer necessary, for threats from the north, west, and south are now immaterial. We can develop transportation infrastructure to and from Germany through the mountain passes."

 boh_cultural_unity_title: "Cultural Unity"
 boh_cultural_unity_desc: "The cultural prosperity and interaction between Bohemia and Germany is such that even common interactions in the Czech lands have adopted considerable German elements and vice versa.

 boh_subordinate_the_estates_desc: "The Estates of Bohemia would be nothing if not an obstacle to complete control over the state apparatus.

 boh_authoritarian_culture_desc: "The successes of a state whose authority undisputably lies in one man's hands cannot be understated. The values of Enlightened Republicanism naturally erode on our borders. So long as the monarchs remain suitably competent society will forever acknowledge the institution of absolute monarchy as fair and natural."
 boh_unite_the_crowns_title: "Unite the Crowns"

 BGM_BOH_missions.1.t: "The Imperial Bank"
 BGM_BOH_missions.1.d: "$MONARCH$ has taken it upon himself to oversee a new financial reform, beneficial to all members of the Empire. A new Imperial Bank will be created, owned and operated by $COUNTRY$ but whose services are extended to all princes within the Holy Roman Empire. Convenient indeed, but one that which may prove detrimental to princes seeking continued sovereignty."
 BGM_BOH_missions.1.a: "Okay."
 BGM_BOH_missions.2.t: "Sharing of Hussite Military Technology"
 BGM_BOH_missions.2.d: "With the Great War to determine the religious fate of the Empire Bohemia decided it is prudent to export military technology to us to aid them. Indeed, this is the Great Struggle to decide the fate of Europe."

 BGM_BOH_missions.3.t: "The Bohemian Revolution"
 BGM_BOH_missions.3.d: "The prevailing morality in Bohemia in recent times has evolved away from absolutism and in favor of personal liberties for the common citizen. Intellectuals in the major cities in and east of Bohemia have agitated the public against perceived misrule by $MONARCH$. They demand a Republic and are willing to fight for one. \n\nAn angry mob has been spearheaded by a public reformer preaching for a change in government over the past few days. Tensions have been flaring up to a degree in which the [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] is forced to meet outside of the Prague Castle to decide whether to continue his reign or surrender to the potential Revolutionaries."

 BGM_BOH_missions.3.b: "Our monarchy stays!"
 BGM_BOH_missions.4.t: "Fate of the Bohemian Military Academies"
 BGM_BOH_missions.4.d: "With wars being as frequent as they are there is reason to believe that the Bohemian military could afford to take lessons from the wars fought in Germany and elsewhere - though more the former. Our military philosophers are inconclusive as to if our military infrastructure should concern itself first and foremost with developing the Officer Corps we already have or expanding the ranks of the military overall."
 BGM_BOH_missions.4.a: "The Army should prioritize discipline."

 bgm_bur_strong_economy_desc: "With the ownership of a sizeable swathe of territory in both France and the Netherlands we should seek to exploit it by all means necessary.

 eng_south_india_title: "Southern India"
 eng_south_india_desc: "South India is geographically closest to Britain by way of African sailing. It may be prudent, then, to control some of the ports there. If not as a stop for far eastern travel, then perhaps the economic potential in the region is just of too much use to pass up..."

 BGM_ENG_missions.3.t: "John Wycliffe"
 BGM_ENG_missions.3.d: "John Wycliffe was an English preacher whose philosophy founded the Christian denomination of Lollardy. It contained a number of criticisms of the Catholic Church not unusual with proto-reformation and Reformationist figures, notably that the Bible should be translated from Latin into English for common use. Wycliffe would be dismissed from Oxford University for spreading these beliefs and he would eventually draw the ire of the Catholic Church itself, most notably from the Archbishop of Canterbury though he would earlier have earned their interest."
 BGM_ENG_missions.3.a: "Okay."
 BGM_ENG_missions.5.t: "The Fate of Anglo-French Relations"
 BGM_ENG_missions.5.d: "England is now at an impasse. There are quite a few doctrines which we can follow in future dealings with the French. If we claim the throne of France it's likely that England's government and court will move to Paris and England will adopt a number of French bureaucratic customs. Retaining the Angevin identity which the Anglo-Norman Nobility are native to would syncretize the English identity to that of the mainland French and the final option to create a strong, centralized Mainland European alliance allows us to create Great Britain."

 fra_deal_with_clergy_desc: "The Clerical institutions of $COUNTRY$ have been viewed by the revolutionaries as historically and currently oppressing the values of the Revolution by enforcing religious dogma and suppressing freedom of speech and belief.

 FRA_occitan_benevolence_title: "Occitan Benevolence"
 FRA_occitan_benevolence_desc: "We can in a way integrate the foreign cultures in France in with the government of $CAPITAL$. Perhaps it's worth our time to demonstrate $COUNTRY$ as a unified force by way of solidarity by partitioning the development of $COUNTRY$ in a more egalitarian manner."
 FRA_bordeaux_development_title: "Bordeaux Development"

 FRA_fortify_pyrenees_title: "Pyrenees Fortifications"

Some of the Dauphine area for instance sees its nexus in Lyons which is informally attached to northern France by way of commerce and navigational infrastructure."
 fra_belgian_development_title: "Flemish Unity"
 fra_belgian_development_desc: "The Duchy of Flanders had a historical association with the French Crown and less so with the Holy Roman Empire and their northern contemporaries. This can be seen to its logical end, where the Flemish are now sufficiently assimilated into French society so as to be little different from their Picard or Walloon counterparts."
 fra_cultural_unity_title: "Cultural Unity"

France Proper will be one."
 fra_continue_reforms_title: "Continue the Reforms"
 fra_continue_reforms_desc: "The previous decades saw an extreme shift in French society. Gone are the days of absolutism - without the Enlightenment at least to consider.

 fra_review_the_military_title: "Reassess the Military"
 fra_review_the_military_desc: "The Army is indeed the pride of France. This fact has transcended controversy within the monarchist and revolutionary dogmas. A large army is quite useful but it is nothing without sufficient quality. Any competent leader should know that his army is what stands between him and being overthrown or deposed."
 fra_broadened_ministries_title: "Broadened Ministries"
 fra_broadened_ministries_desc: "A recent proposition in the reform process has proven relatively unpopular with the highest leadership of $COUNTRY$ but is in our best interest. A charter to strip some authority away from the rulership and into the hands of ministers under the command of a Prime Minister is in order."
 fra_diplomatic_review_title: "Diplomatic Review"
 fra_diplomatic_review_desc: "It cannot be stressed enough that the world is ever changing. Sometimes military primacy isn't enough, sometimes we have to rely on reliable alliances. A reliable diplomatic corps can help us along in this regard."
 fra_into_the_future_title: "Into the Future"
 fra_into_the_future_desc: "The means by which $COUNTRY$ can guarantee future stability have all been upgraded to modern standards. A case can be made we have constructed the first full modern nation-state in human history. Not that any of this is material; it is time to influence world politics once again."

 fra_algerie_france_title: "Algerie France"
 fra_algerie_france_desc: "Barbary pirates, internal turmoil or other matters have brought to our attention the necessity of conquest in the Algerian region directly to the south across the Mediterranean.

 fra_indochina_title: "$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Indochina"
 fra_indochina_desc: "A far-eastern base of operations, Indochina produces some industrial materials such as rubber. Rubber can see applications for navigating difficult terrain either in the creation of footwear designed for this purpose or for molding the outer rims of tires. Even if this is not the case, we will be able to tap into the foreign markets in East Asia and hopefully make an attempt to assert our own authority in the general vicinity."
 fra_madagascar_title: "Madagascar"

 fra_defeat_the_revolution_title: "Defeat the Revolution"
 fra_defeat_the_revolution_desc: "The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has put to rest the upstarts of the previous years with confidence. Although some modernism here and there may be of utility $COUNTRY$ by large sees a resurgence in conservative thought. Religion and State which the Revolutionaries view as antithetical to morality is the norm and as the head of the Reactionary movement we must first demonstrate and lead by example for christians across the world to emulate."
 fra_formalize_catechesis_title: "Formalize Catechesis"
 fra_formalize_catechesis_desc: "Christians and revolutionaries alike express the need for human rights. One such right named in these ideals is the right to an education. As a Christian state therefore we stand only to gain from creating catechisms for use in religious education, for morality must form early in life."
 fra_authoritarian_rhetoric_title: "Authoritarianism"
 fra_authoritarian_rhetoric_desc: "A society works best when it has great leaders. With Christian religion to instill strict morality paired with the aforementioned belief we have a simple template to handle issues that other ideologies find difficult to resolve."
 fra_reformed_state_title: "Reformed State"
 fra_reformed_state_desc: "Two fundamental aspects of our society are in the closing phases of being resolved. A religious educational program with proliferation of the ideals of a centralized state headed by a benevolent monarch will realize prosperous communities across the nation."

 fra_integralism_title: "Integralist Doctrine"
 fra_integralism_desc: "It would seem an ideology of some sorts has came about to describe the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state. Integralism, or the belief in authoritarian, conservative Christian ethics and policymaking.

 fra_expand_informant_network_title: "Informant Networks"
 fra_expand_informant_network_desc: "The Revolutionaries for a time relied on a network of informants when attempting to locate targets for their purges. For the sake of $COUNTRY$'s national security we may need to consider these options, as drastic as they may appear to be."
 fra_renewed_nationalism_title: "Revitalized Nationalism"
 fra_renewed_nationalism_desc: "There are forces in the world that seek to dispel a natural sense of in-group preference from politics. What do you have if you have no country?"
 fra_emphasize_family_title: "Family Values"

 fra_value_of_work_title: "The Value of Work"
 fra_value_of_work_desc: "Work is a duty rewarded by money. However, it can also be rewarded with pride. Every man must know the value of his work to both himself and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ society. For his contribution to greater society indirectly secures our future prosperity and decreases the risk of conquest by forces within or without."
 fra_travail_famille_patrie_title: "Travail, Famille, Patrie"
 fra_travail_famille_patrie_desc: "Work, Family, Fatherland. The three countermeasures to the degeneration illustrated by the motto 'liberté, egalité, fraternité'. $COUNTRY$ has been strengthened by the revolution.

 fra_compromise_revolution_title: "A New Charter"
 fra_compromise_revolution_desc: "Through concessions and great oratory skill our rulership has avoided the worst of the Revolution. A constitutional monarchy has been established in its wake and the people of $COUNTRY$ are once again at peace."
 fra_empower_bourgeoisie_title: "Embolden the Bourgeoisie"
 fra_empower_bourgeoisie_desc: "In both the Ancien Régime and in governments of the Revolutionaries the Bourgeois class has been left with a sense of insecurity. We will not tolerate the destruction of our country's most successful merchants or their direct subordination to a state. They will flourish on their own."
 fra_laissez_faire_title: "Laissez-Faire Economy"
 fra_laissez_faire_desc: "$COUNTRY$ needs to deregulate the economy to facilitate long-form growth. We will surpass the Englishman and the Dutch, even at their own game. Eventually the wealth will trickle down and a booming middle class will be born of our future-oriented policymaking."
 fra_legal_egalitarianism_title: "Legal Egalitarianism"
 fra_legal_egalitarianism_desc: "In times past the legal system has discriminated against the commoner among others while giving slaps on the wrist to citizens of higher society, such as noblemen and individuals in clerical occupations - that is, if they were even prosecuted. Our highly reformed and enlightened government will rid itself of these errors."
 fra_expand_political_franchise_title: "Expand Franchisement"
 fra_expand_political_franchise_desc: "We must guarantee the right to vote to all Frenchmen over an age and wealth boundary like other democratic states of our day. A Revolutionary concept indeed, but one that is full well necessary if we are to prevent another Revolution..."
 fra_disallow_conscription_title: "Disallow Conscription"
 fra_disallow_conscription_desc: "Conscription is, at the end of the day, against the principles of freedom. Needing to force a man against his will to fight for his country is a hallmark of an unpopular administration. If we are to prove superiority in all manners over our neighbors, we must establish ourselves as the preeminent military force in Europe. And in addition to this we must challenge ourselves to remain an ever-popular government so forced military service would be entirely redundant and devoid of purpose."
 fra_guarantee_due_process_title: "Guarantee Due Process"
 fra_guarantee_due_process_desc: "Due process is unfortunately not very common in an era dominated by authoritarian states. $COUNTRY$ will demonstrate she is not like the others.

 fra_journal_of_debates_title: "The Journal of Debates"
 fra_journal_of_debates_desc: "The Journal des débats was a publication that could be described during the revitalized French monarchy as conservative, though opposed to Napoleon. Its publications were not always political, sometimes cultural or artistic. The flourishing of the press is a natural state of affairs for a free parliamentary society."
 fra_religious_freedom_title: "Religious Freedom"
 fra_religious_freedom_desc: "For centuries the Church has not taken kindly to individuals professing their own iteration of the Christian faith. From the Waldensians to the Protestants, the Catholic Church was afforded free reign to act as they wished to supplant any potential reformation before it began in earnest. This is not fair to the common man, and we will write an amendment in the Charter of $COUNTRY$ disallowing religious persecution and the freedom of the state to prosecute religious abuse."
 fra_guarantee_private_property_rights_title: "Private Property"
 fra_guarantee_private_property_rights_desc: "The state has a duty as the guarantor of the right to own property to all citizens of $COUNTRY$. Where other states only allow the nobility to own property, in our state every man is a Noble Man."
 fra_complete_the_charter_title: "Complete the Charter"
 fra_complete_the_charter_desc: "With momentous effort the newfound Nation of $COUNTRY$ has reformed state and society into a synthesis of Revolution and Reaction. A compromise on a plethora of subjects was once thought unattainable what with the immense dogma of decades past. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ is unique for he is pragmatic, never dogmatic."
 fra_fate_of_faith_title: "Fate of Faith"
 fra_fate_of_faith_desc: "The question of religion in $COUNTRY$ must be answered. However easy this may seem, the context of our day makes this question surprisingly difficult to answer. The separation of Church and State sees resistance in one form or another by conservatives as well as the most ardent of Revolutionaries. For the Revolutionaries seek to impose a new faith for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen. Be it the Cult of Reason, the Supreme Being, or otherwise, we are in for a time of religious turbulence."
 fra_republican_calendar_title: "Republican Calendar"
 fra_republican_calendar_desc: "The government has chosen. The government has chosen to annihilate all influence of the Ancien Régime from our new society.

 fra_secular_taxation_title: "Secular Taxation"
 fra_secular_taxation_desc: "In the Ancien Régime the Church was responsible for levying taxes to the state. However we have distanced ourselves from such institutions and need a new form of fundraising.

 fra_new_administrative_organization_title: "Administrative Reorganization"
 fra_new_administrative_organization_desc: "Under the regime of old France was organized into Provinces. In keeping with the Revolution though these are referential to the old order and as such must be removed. $COUNTRY$ will be reorganized into administrative Départements, Prefectures and Communes."
 fra_facilitate_parisian_commerce_title: "[Root.Capital.GetAdjective] Commerce"
 fra_facilitate_parisian_commerce_desc: "The unique stability afforded to us and the preferential treatment for the Bourgeoisie means an informal directive of sorts has came about to facilitate commerce through the many rivers in France. See to it that the capital is a nexus of trade throughout the entire continent and a capital to envy."
 fra_reform_provincial_administrations_title: "Reform the Provinces"
 fra_reform_provincial_administrations_desc: "The provinces of old have proven to us to constitute an old offensive mess to new politicians. They demand a reformation of the administrative system immediately and we have faith that doing so will afford the state a more streamlined administrative process."
 fra_commercial_hegemon_title: "Commercial Hegemony"
 fra_commercial_hegemon_desc: "The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchant has been allowed to prosper such that within the society of $COUNTRY$ there is a titanic market by way of comparison to other European contemporaries vying (and failing) for influence here. Our businesses will see their influence stretch to the four corners of the globe."
 fra_privatized_banking_title: "Privatized Banking"
 fra_privatized_banking_desc: "The Central Bank of $COUNTRY$ must be a hybrid of a public and privately owned institution. It must be public in that it is beholden to the will of the state, but private in manners that it is beholden to the competitive edge unique to capitalism. With these two considerations in mind our government must work to pass legislation which creates a centralized, semi-private treasury."
 fra_coal_exploitation_title: "Coal Exploitation"
 fra_coal_exploitation_desc: "Coal's applications have been growing ever since the inventive minds of our era began engineering new machines with higher energy requirements. The energy density in Coal is just right to see these new machines prosper as $COUNTRY$ is accelerated into a new age of invention and revolution; an Industrial Revolution."
 fra_countryside_development_title: "Countryside Development"

 fra_black_gold_title: "Black Gold"
 fra_black_gold_desc: "Black Gold - an artistic name for Oil, but originally coal. This resource can prove essential to us in the coming years as the number of uses for Oil increases. It may even drive the world around economically sometime. Therefore, we must first secure many of the major deposits to ensure an early competitive edge."
 fra_national_assembly_title: "Assemblée Nationale"
 fra_national_assembly_desc: "The peasants have rejected the Estates General and moved to create their own assembly in $CAPITAL$! Anger against the government would continue unchecked as any attempts to secure the assembly were met with violent retaliations. The armories of our capital have been seized by the rebels and with popular support a new government has been proclaimed. Long Live the $COUNTRY_ADJ$! Vive la $COUNTRY$!"
 fra_logistics_development_title: "Logistics Development"
 fra_logistics_development_desc: "With the growing size of armies and the increasing sophistication of technology we will have to review the logistics program of $COUNTRY$.

 fra_ideological_military_title: "Ideological Military"

 BGM_FRA_missions.1.d: "We are in a unique, once-in-a-lifetime position to set a precedent which will decide the fate of French foreign policy. We can act in favor of uniting France with the Holy Roman Empire in a bid to consolidate it under our control or we can decide against that to focus on our own lands instead."

 BGM_FRA_missions.2.a: "The English mustn't be allowed to exist."
 BGM_FRA_missions.2.b: "Let's take the Carolingian Mantle."

 BGM_FRA_missions.4.d: "$MONARCH$'s attempts to reform $COUNTRY$ have gone awry. Unassuming as they were, the nobility launched a coup to overthrow the monarch. A new ruler will be appointed.

 BGM_FRA_missions.5.t: "Foreign Policy"
 BGM_FRA_missions.5.d: "Our monarch is at an impasse. We can spend time attempting to conquer the Italian states or we may instead devote our time in southern France.

 BGM_FRA_missions.7.d: "The King of England rules Aquitaine himself, but feudal law has stipulated in our case that Aquitaine in fact is a subordinate realm of the King of France, thus making the King of England a fiefdom of the French crown.

 BGM_FRA_missions.8.t: "France Requests Aquitaine"
 BGM_FRA_missions.8.d: "The King Charles of France has called for us to send a Plantagenêt representative to France to handle the matters of the Duchy of Aquitaine.

 BGMTE.1.t: "Victory in the Red Turban Rebellion"
 BGMTE.1.d: "Initially it appeared the Red Turban rebellion was getting out of hand. The leader of the rebellion claimed himself the Emperor of China too soon. His attempt at throwing the Yuan out of China has failed. It's time for $MONARCH$ to move the capital back to Khanbaliq, where it must always remain."
 BGMTE.1.a: "We will once again take our rightful place."
 BGMTE.2.t: "England in the Late Middle Ages"
 BGMTE.2.d: " In 1066 A.D. the succession of England was in grave crisis. Initially, Harald Hardrada invaded from Scandinavia to attempt to seize the Throne of England for himself but was defeated by Harold Godwinson. Later, William of Normandy would make a successful invasion with support from the Papacy and the Duke of Brittany. All three were claimants to the succession of the King Edward who did not name an heir. The result of all of this was William's rise to power and by extension the initiation of influence from the Norman French Nobility who elected to forcibly oust all influence from the previous Anglo-Saxons in power. \n\nNothing of significance would occur until the 1200's when the English peasantry revolted and secured the implementation of the Magna Carta and the creation of Parliament in a bid to guarantee long-form rights for themselves. In 1337 the succession of France became a matter of considerable debate as the French did not wish to allow the King of England to also assume the Crown of France. Because the succession would pass through a female, Salic law was invoked to deny the English control of France and the cadet branch of Valois was placed on the Throne instead. This would be contested by the Plantagenêt dynasty who would go on to initiate the Hundred Years' War, which by this point has been raging on but with interruptions for thirty-one years. \n\nFrance and England are currently vying for influence in Castile which is in a state of crisis as Henry II is attempting to, with support from Aragon and France, take control of Castile from Peter of Ivrea. A notable poet by the name of Geoffrey Chaucer was active at this time and is available for employment at the royal court."
 BGMTE.2.a: "Acknowledged"
 BGMTE.3.t: "The Red Turban Rebellion"
 BGMTE.3.d: "The Yuan Dynasty was fraught with numerous internal issues from its outset. Initially there was a question concerning the matter of sinicizing the state and ruling class or retain its Mongolian traditions. Domestic policing abilities were proven incapable by the thirteen-fourties since Yuan military garrisons had proven ineffective in maintaining order in the lands of China Proper. Since the forces of the government were proven inept, local leaders took it upon themselves to enforce order. It was only a matter of time since then that, given the principle of the Mandate of Heaven, a newcomer would come to take the responsibility. The Hongwu Emperor as he is known to history has been coronated as the Emperor of China on the twenty-third of January, making him the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty and the first ethnic Han to rule in quite some time, ever since the fall of the Song to the Mongol Empire in the 1200's. Nevertheless, the Yuan Dynasty under threat of total destruction should it continue to prove its inability to control the Middle Kingdom of China and prove its legitimacy."
 BGMTE.3.a: "Acknowledged"
 BGMTE.4.t: "The Collapse of the Serbian Empire"
 BGMTE.4.d: "The Serbian Empire is a young state already entrenched with trouble. Initially Stefan Dusan (the predecessor of Stefan Uros V) managed to conquer sizeable apportionments of territory, most notably in Macedonia and Greece. Dusan was considered popular by the nobility who favored him despite his father's wishes for his younger brother to inherit the Kingdom. Dusan would only rule Serbia for nine years. His successor Stefan Uros V was not capable of consolidating the holdings his father conquered and the Serbian Empire would begin coming apart as he was not successful in reining in the nobility who were in control of Dusan's new conquests. Uros has proven incapable of having an heir which seems to further jeopardize the nascent Serbian Empire. A rapidly expanding Ottoman Sultanate will almost certainly prove a grave danger should Serbia not manage to resolve its impending crisis in due time."
 BGMTE.4.a: "Acknowledged"
 BGMTE.5.t: "The Great Troubles"
 BGMTE.5.d: "The Golden Horde is one of the successor states to the Mongol Empire. Forged for one of Genghis Khan's generals, he would see the Golden Horde's expansion westward as far as Romania in the early thirteenth century. Eventually in the late twelve-hundreds there would be a great succession crisis in the Mongol Empire as Möngke Khan died culminating in the Toluid Civil War. Batu Khan would be the first ruler of the Golden Horde to operate with autonomy unlike Jochi, his predecessor. The Golden Horde would see a golden age lasting for sixty years from the twelve-fourties to the early fourteenth century, albeit with interruptions. Later efforts were devoted to the prevention of the formation of a Russian state which would become troublesome in the thirteen-fifties. The Great Troubles would begin in 1359 as a persisting civil war on the matter of inheritance as the Khan, Berdi Beg, would be killed by his brother in an attempt to overthrow Beg's government. The Black Death did nothing to help the situation, ravaging the country like with most of Eurasia just before the start of The Golden Horde's succession crisis. Because of this, the Golden Horde's influence in Russia is waning and the realms there are ready to exploit our troubles."

 BGMTE.6.t: "The Reign of Charles IV"
 BGMTE.6.d: "Charles IV's reign has been thus far the most successful for the state of Bohemia. He has worked to preserve peace within the Empire by forging confederations and created the persistent Golden Bull of 1356 which named the electors and the manner of succession for the Holy Roman Empire. Prague was renovated to a degree as to rival the prestige of Paris. To do so Charles constructed the Charles University, renovated the Cathedral of Vitus, had the Prague Castle rebuilt, and created a city square named after him. He would also be the last claimant to the Kingdom of Arles, a successor state to the old Kingdom of Burgundy, whose existence began in 933 A.D."

 BGMTE.11.t: "Tumult of Joanna"
 BGMTE.11.d: "The reign of Joanna of Naples has been turbulent thus far and it would not appear that the intrigues and foreign adversarial states intend to relieve us of the anxiety of an invasion. Joanna's sole ally in all of this appears to be the Papacy, an alliance she received by ceding Avignon to them formally. \n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary remains a notable enemy, having attempted to force a union with Naples over the death of Joanna's first husband, Andrew. The papacy intervened on behalf of Joanna and the invasion did not achieve its goals. Attempts to have heirs have largely failed for Joanna, though her legitimacy would wax and wane throughout her reign.\n\nThe Queen must navigate politics with great care to see Naples through the coming years with prosperity."

 BGMYC.2.a: "A beautiful time to be alive."
 BGMYC.5.t: "Collapse of the Yuan Dynasty"
 BGMYC.5.d: "The Yuan has fallen into disarray and has failed in its attempts to subordinate the Chinese. Authority everywhere but the Mongol steppe region has faded as Toghon Temür will be remembered not so fondly. Without claim to the Celestial Empire, the former Yuan's identity has changed to that of the Oirat."
 BGMYC.5.a: "Such tragedies.."
 BGMYC.6.t: "Collapse of the Yuan Dynasty"
 BGMYC.6.d: "The Yuan has fallen into disarray and has failed in its attempts to subordinate the Chinese. Authority everywhere but the Mongol steppe region has faded as Toghon Temür will be remembered not so fondly. Without claim to the Celestial Empire, the former Yuan's identity has changed to that of the Mongolian."
 BGMYC.6.a: "Such tragedies.."
 BGMYC.7.t: "Army Desertions"
 BGMYC.7.d: "Part of the Yuan army is staffed by Chinese troops and officers out of necessity. Unfortunately many of these often side with the Ming and desert to their side as a consequence. Before long we will be forced to employ the services of Mercenary Armies..."
 BGMYC.7.a: "They will know why they shouldn't have betrayed us in due time."
 BGMYC.8.t: "The Ming Seize Yunnan"
 BGMYC.8.d: "The provinces of the Yunnan region have defected to the Ming Dynasty, citing their faith that the Ming possess the Mandate of Heaven. Maybe one day they will see reason and return to us..."
 BGMYC.8.a: "We certainly hope so."

 BGMH.1.t: "The Harelle"
 BGMH.1.d: "The peasantry have grown rather upset at the reimposition of new taxes which were temporarily abolished in times past. In Paris and other notable cities it seems tax collectors were attacked and the property of the rich have been compromised. Rioting has broken out in various places and we risk the whole country descending into revolt should the matter not be promptly addressed."
 BGMH.1.a: "Oh dear."
 BGMH.2.t: "Victory over the Harelle"
 BGMH.2.d: "The peasantry in $COUNTRY$ have been defeated by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and intervention by its fiefdoms. Negotations with the remaining leaders with $MONARCH$ and the various dukes have been resolved. The terms were"
 BGMH.2.a: "The rebels were forced to concede their demands.."
 BGMH.2.b: "The $MONARCHTITLE$ has decided to make a compromise.."
 BGMH.3.t: "Defeat in the Harelle"
 BGMH.3.d: "The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ populace has overwhelmed the state and enforced authority over a largely absent regime, in the process causing a sort of temporary anarchy to reign in $COUNTRY$. Devastation has been rampant though this short stint of liberty would ultimately die down and taxes have once again be abolished by popular demand."
 BGMH.3.a: "Okay."
 BGMH.4.t: "$PROVINCE$ joins the Harelle"
 BGMH.4.d: "The city of $PROVINCE$ and the local countryside have seen inspiration from the example of other towns' rioting and have elected to join in the revolt."

 BGWT.1.t: "English Peasants' Revolt"
 BGWT.1.d: "The previous decades saw a storm of conditions which would eventually manifest as a violent public outcry against the English Crown. The Black Death had killed nearly half of the European continent resulting in condensed wealth for the survivors, in turn causing the Acts of Apparel which disallowed commoners from dressing similar to nobility, taxes being levied to fund England's role in the Hundred Years' War and the composition of the government. John of Gaunt became a rather well known but seemingly controversial figure. He was in support of the Lollards who were not liked very much by the locals in London, at least. Uproar over serfdom was also another grievance the commoners had against the state, as were the expanded anti-treason laws enacted at the time, enabling the state to punish families over merely criminal suspects. The peasantry would initially protest but things would eventually get out of hand. The Tower of London was attacked and royal officials inside were killed. We live in a potentially fateful stretch of time as the English public may once again prove their force of arms overpowers the state."
 BGWT.1.a: "Oh dear.."
 BGWT.2.t: "Victory in the English Peasants' Revolt"
 BGWT.2.d: "The Crown of England has risen to the moment against the peasant revolt which has as such been defeated. Its leaders are either deceased or have been placed under arrest. It now falls on $MONARCH$ to determine the fate of the rebels' demands. Will there be clemency?"
 BGWT.2.a: "No."
 BGWT.2.b: "Yes."
 BGWT.3.t: "Defeat in the English Peasants' Revolt"
 BGWT.3.d: "The Crown of England was forced to submit to the Peasants' Revolt in its entirety. Parliament has been strengthened to the expense of the $DYNASTY$'s power. Otherwise the rebels' demands have been answered to without much concession being necessary on the part of the popular leadership."
 BGWT.3.a: "What a disaster!"
 BGWT.5.t: "East England Joins the Rebellion"
 BGWT.5.d: "The notable cities in Eastern England have elected to join the popular rebellion around London. Citing a perceived oppression by the Crown and Nobility, they demand reduced taxes and further guarantees of freedom and/or egalitarian treatment."
 BGWT.5.a: "Acknowledged"

 catholicism_consolidated: "§YAll provinces and countries adherent to the other papacy will become loyal to our cause.§!"
 BGMWS.1.t: "The Western Schism"
 BGMWS.1.d: "The Western Schism began as a consequence of the Roman Clergy's desire to see the capital of the Papacy return. They used any means necessary, up to and including intimidation. This as such brought the cardinals voting for $MONARCH$ to decide again that their votes were illegitimate as they were coerced by an outside force. They elected a new pope on their own but now a religious crisis has unfolded. There are now two popes vying for complete dominion over the Catholic Church. No longer is this a clerical issue but now a geopolitical one."
 BGMWS.1.a: "Oh dear..."
 BGMWS.2.t: "Fate of the Papacy"
 BGMWS.2.d: "We've found ourselves at a great crossroads. We may either follow the path of the Avignon Papacy or instead elect to follow the Roman Catholic Papacy."
 BGMWS.2.a: "Select the Roman Papacy."
 BGMWS.2.b: "Select the Avignon Papacy."
 BGMWS.2.c: "Select the Pisan Papacy."
 BGMWS.3.t: "The Avignon Papacy"
 BGMWS.3.d: "The seat of the Avignon Papacy has been designated in our territory of Avignon. They will prove to be our subject but we will gain substantial benefits for siding with them, even as their overlord. We may even acquire a disproportionate amount of influence in their papacy."
 BGMWS.3.a: "Acknowledged"
 BGMWS.6.t: "The Fate of the Western Schism"
 BGMWS.6.d: "The Papacies have managed to resolve their crisis and disputes through negotiation. The most trusted papacy has secured the loyalty of the Catholic Church and its institutions."
 BGMWS.6.a: "The die is cast."
 BGMHW.1.t: "Death of Jan Hus"
 BGMHW.1.d: "Jan Hus was a notable preacher who distanced himself from the Catholic Church in the wake of the Western Schism though attempted to support reconciliation. He would begin preaching in Prague what would ultimately manifest as a dissident religion which would come to be known as Hussitism. Hus would ultimately continue operating in $COUNTRY$ until his beliefs were no longer tolerated and he was sentenced to execution. As a consequence he became a martyr and his posthumous influence would prove far more disastrous than when he was alive. If the Hussite threat is not properly contained swiftly there is a very real risk it blows up into an international reform movement."
 BGMHW.1.a: "Oh dear.."
 BGMHW.1.b: "This man spoke the truth!"
 BGMHW.2.t: "End of the Hussite Wars"
 BGMHW.2.d: "The religious crisis of the previous years has finally ended and $COUNTRY$ can once again appeal to a new prosperous age."
 BGMHW.2.a: "Okay"
 BGMHW.3.t: "Hussite Militia in [This.GetName]"
 BGMHW.3.d: "An army loyal to the nascent Hussite cause has sprung up in our country. Since they are most likely not interested in negotiations, it seems we will have to turn to a solution involving the military."
 BGMHW.3.a: "One way or another.."
 BGMHW.4.t: "Hussite Preachers in [This.GetName]"
 BGMHW.4.d: "Priests belonging to the new Hussite faith have started preaching their religion in [This.GetName]. The problem is that they appear to have grown rather popular there..."
 BGMHW.4.a: "We will have to deal with them somehow."
 BGMHW.5.t: "The Concomitant Reformationists"
 BGMHW.5.d: "Seeing the success of the Hussite Reformation, priests in $COUNTRY$ have rallied and have taken to proselytizing their own brand of reformism."
 BGMHW.5.a: "Oh dear.."
 BGMHW.6.t: "Waldensian Opportunism"
 BGMHW.6.d: "Seeing the success of the Hussite Reformation, priests in the Waldensian Valley have rallied and have taken to expanding operations, proselytizing their own brand of reformism, succeeding in the cities of $PROVINCE$."
 BGMHW.6.a: "Oh dear.."
 BGMHW.7.t: "Failure of the Hussite Reformation"
 BGMHW.7.d: "The Religious Wars have ended in failure for the Hussite Reformationist factions. Their apparent inability to secure any major powers' convictions after such time means the seeds are sown for Catholic unity once more. Few will be convinced of the need for new religious denominations, at least for now."
 BGMHW.7.a: "We aspire for unanimity."
 BGMWS.7.t: "The Pisan Papacy"
 BGMWS.7.d: "In an effort to reconcile the Avignon and Roman Papacies, a new proposition has been forwarded to create a third, nonpartisan religious seat."
 BGMWS.7.a: "We will not do that."
 BGMWS.7.b: "Okay."
